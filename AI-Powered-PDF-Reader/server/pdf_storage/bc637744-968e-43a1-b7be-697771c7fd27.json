I was 17 years old, \na junior in high school, and one of the top World of War -\ncraft players in North America. Long gone were the days of \nthe internet only being used by forward-thinking entrepre -\nneurs and computer scientists. The social digital revolution \nhad begun: Facebook was three years old, YouTube was \ntwo, and Twitter was a newborn wailing at the top of \nits lungs. \nRight before school let out for the summer, this new \nwebsite emerged in the competitive gaming community, \ncalled GameRiot. It was a “social media” site for gamers—\nbefore the term “social media” had even become part of \nthe world’s vocabulary. I’d heard about the site from a \ngaming blogger I loved reading. Every morning before \nschool, I would wake up, make myself two eggs on toast \n(wheat), and read his latest blog. He was one of the few \ntop-tier gamers who actually had his own website, so when \nhe made a post one morning saying he was going to start \nwriting somewhere else instead, I knew to pay attention.\nWhile the rest of my family played in the pool in the back -\nyard, I was upstairs in my bedroom. With freezing cold air \nblasting out of the air conditioner above my head, I sat at \nmy desk hunched over my keyboard with my face three \ninches from my monitor, exploring GameRiot. \n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n2\nIntroductionI was staring at one of the internet’s first “social blogs,” \nexclusively for gamers.\nSimilar to the way a Facebook or Twitter feed looked, the \ncenter of the website was an infinite scrolling feed of posts. \nCatering to the “gamer” mentality, in the upper right-hand \ncorner there was a leaderboard of the Top 10 most popu -\nlar blogs on the site—and sure enough, sitting at #1, was \na recent post by my favorite gaming blogger, Ming.\nI decided, right then and there, \nI was going to become a competitive \nblogger too.\nThe reason I didn’t start a website of my own was because \nI didn’t know how.\nIn the mid 2000s, there were no website templates, no \neasy-to-use graphic design tools, no one-click solutions. \nAlmost everything had to be custom designed and coded. \nAnd since I had no money, I couldn’t afford to hire some -\none to help me.\nBut on this new site for gamers, all of that was taken care of.\nWhen you created your own profile, you could easily \nupload a photo and write a short bio. You could browse \nother people’s posts on the front page. You could scroll \nthrough different topics. You could comment, and other \npeople could comment back to you. The whole website was \na game, no different to me than the World of Warcraft—\nand without thinking twice about it, I decided I was going \nto start writing there too.\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\n3\nIntroductionEvery night, after playing 3v3 against some of the top \ngamers in the world, I would close the World of Warcraft \nand write that night’s blog post. At first, I tried to make my \nblog the go-to resource for high-level gameplay informa -\ntion, breaking down team compositions, winning strategies, \nand little tricks to give gamers a competitive edge. But over \ntime, I started to realize it wasn’t the informative stuff that \nmade the front page—it was drama. \nGamers loved knowing which teams had rivalries with \nwho, which players had lost their shit after a loss, and who \nhad been sneaky enough to capture an audio recording of \nthe outburst for the entire World of Warcraft community to \nhear. More importantly, they wanted to know what some of \nthe best players were like in real life.\nIt didn’t take me long to realize that readers didn’t just \nwant to learn how to be better gamers themselves. \nThey also wanted to be entertained.\nWatching Ming execute this strategy perfectly, I began \nto mirror my writing style off his. Every one of his posts \nwas a blend between informative content and controver -\nsy-inducing tangents. In one single paragraph, he would \ngo from explaining the inner workings of the Rogue class \nto venting about how his Asian parents had arranged his \nupcoming marriage and the whole event was getting in \nthe way of his 3v3 team making it to BlizzCon’s first ever \nArena World Championship Tournament. The comment \nsection of his posts would explode with gamers either \ncuriously wanting to know more about his love life, or rid -\niculing him for thinking the World of Warcraft was more \nimportant than his wedding day. \n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n4\nIntroductionThis is what made Ming the #1 most-read writer on the \nsite week after week, month after month.\nEverything changed for me when I started \nincorporating more of my real life into \nmy writing.\nI wrote about how my parents, my teachers, even my peers \nat high school didn’t respect video games—but for some \nreason enthusiastically supported football, basketball, and \nother organized sports. \nI wrote about organized education, and how as long as the \ninternet continued to develop, I continued to lose faith in \nthere being a real need to attend college. \nI even wrote about the most popular girl in school, a bru -\nnette cheerleader, and how there was one week of my \nhigh school career where a series of unfathomable events \nunfolded: I went to my very first high school party ever; \nword got out that I was one of the top World of Warcraft \nplayers in the country; the hottest girl in our school pro -\nfessed her love to me; we went on a date; kissed; rumors \nstarted flying we were dating; I catapulted from the \nbottom of the social totem pole to the absolute peak; then \nshe started getting made fun of for liking me; she denied \nanything ever happened; then she made up reverse rumors \nabout how I was obsessed with her and probably a stalker; \nand by the end of the week, I was right back to sitting \nby myself during lunch—except this time, with threats \ncoming from the entire baseball team that if I ever talked \nto her again, I’d get my head bashed in with a baseball bat. \nAll of which was true.\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\n5\nIntroductionAs a result, I instantly became one of the most popular \nwriters on the site.\nAnd by the time I took a seat in my first journalism class at \nthe University of Missouri, one year later, I was one of the \nmost-read gaming writers on the internet.\n“The internet is a fad, blogging is a trend, \nand real journalism will never die,” my \ncollege professor said.\nAt the bottom of a sea of 500 students, my Intro to Journal -\nism professor stood on a wooden stage and paced back and \nforth with a microphone in his hand. I was sitting in the \nvery back row. Every single student below me and around \nme was wearing black and yellow, the school’s colors, with \na silver MacBook Pro in front of them and Facebook on \ntheir screen. I was wearing a brown hoodie, refreshing my \ngaming blog.\n“The only way anyone could possibly be seen as a credible \nwriter on the internet,” he said, “was if they had more than \n10,000 readers on their blog.”\nThe class laughed out loud—not because they thought he \nwas wrong, but because they agreed with him. \n10,000 daily readers seemed impossible in 2008.\nI raised my hand.\n“I don’t think the internet is a trend,” I said. Every single \nstudent in the auditorium rustled in their seats to look \nat me.\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\n6\nIntroduction“Then I suppose you have 10,000 readers on your blog too?” \nthe professor said, chuckling into his microphone, assum -\ning that would stop the conversation right then and there. \nThe only people who had that sort of web traffic were \ncolumnists at major publications.\nI raised my hand again. Not waiting to be called on, I said, \n“Yea, I do.”\nMy teacher didn’t believe me, which was fine because \nI didn’t believe him either. I couldn’t imagine a future that \ndidn’t involve the internet. Blogging was only the begin -\nning. And if he truly thought print journalism was never \ngoing to die, then I was in the wrong major.\nI didn’t show up to that class for the rest of the semester, \nand transferred schools the very next year.\nI moved back to Chicago to study creative writing.\nMany of the key lessons I learned about \nOnline Writing as a teenager wouldn’t \nbecome conscious until almost seven \nyears later.\nMy journey to becoming one of the most-read writers on \nthe internet truly started when I graduated from Columbia \nCollege Chicago with a degree in fiction writing.\nI had just started working at a local advertising agency \nas an entry-level copywriter. For the first time in my life, \nI started to learn what it actually meant to “build a brand.” \nTerms like exposure, audience, engagement,  gave me a lan -\nguage for many of the things I had intuitively understood \n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n7\nIntroductionas a teenage gamer, but never knew what to call them. \nI didn’t know that 10,000 people reading my blog every \nday made me “an influencer.” I didn’t realize that hundreds \nof thousands of views equated to “brand exposure,” or \nthat the thirty, forty, fifty comments on every single one \nof my posts meant I had a higher “engagement rate” than \nother bloggers.\nI had tried starting a blog during college, called Nothin’ But \nA Notepad , but it was largely unsuccessful. I never once \nsurpassed more than 100 views on any of my posts. I was \nusing a standard blogging platform, called Blogger, and \neven had my own profile and URL. I could customize the \ncolor of the header and a few of the design elements. But it \nwas missing the most important piece of the puzzle: there \nwas no social component, no way for readers to explore \nand discover new, interesting writers. And without this \ndiscovery feature, the likelihood of someone coming across \nmy blog was slim to none.\nThere was no “game.”\nAs soon as I graduated from college, I found myself day -\ndreaming in the middle of the work day as to how I was \ngoing to “make it” as a writer. I decided to text a gamer \nfriend of mine and ask his opinion on where I should \nstart writing online. He was a professional World of War -\ncraft player and YouTuber with a few hundred thousand \nsubscribers, and was extremely savvy when it came to \nunderstanding how to capture and keep people’s attention.\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\n8\nIntroduction“If gamers and vloggers have YouTube, \nand fitness models and fashionistas have \nInstagram, where should writers, write?” \nI asked.\nIt wasn’t really Facebook. And it wasn’t really Twitter.\n“You should take a look at Quora,” he said.\nI’d never heard of it.\nOn the surface, Quora was a cleaner looking version of \nYahoo! Answers—the weirdly honest Question/Answer site \nthat felt more like an anonymous, user-generated WebMD \nthan the “knowledge market” it claimed to be. On Quora, \nhowever, anyone could ask a question, and anyone could \nwrite an answer—but all the highest-performing answers \nwere written from credible, engaging, articulate people. The \nquestions ranged from, “What’s it like to be in the courtroom \nwith a convicted murderer?” to “How do I lose weight?”\nFor the rest of the afternoon, and the rest of the week, and \nultimately the rest of the month, all I did was read answers \non Quora. My feed was filled with a never-ending stream \nof questions—and attached to them, answers written like \nshort stories. That’s what hooked me. Someone would ask \nthe question, “What’s it like to be a serial entrepreneur?” \nand the most popular answer wasn’t a formal definition \nof entrepreneurship. It was an answer that started with, \n“When I was 20 years old, I sold my first company for \na million dollars.” And before I could even decide whether \nor not I wanted to keep reading the thing in front of me, \nI was already flying through the second paragraph, dying \nto know what happened next.\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\n9\nIntroductionEvery single question on Quora was \na creative writing prompt.\nAt least, that’s the way I saw it.\nThe most popular answers, the ones with the most views, \nupvotes, and comments, weren’t “answers,” as much as \nthey were stories . And the people with the most followers \nweren’t celebrities, but natural-born storytellers. They \nwould turn the question, “What do you regret most in \nlife?” into a nostalgic retelling of getting married too \nyoung. They would transform, “Does mustard go with \nchicken?” into an analytical thinkpiece you would be more \naccustomed to finding in The New Yorker.  Even questions \nlike, “How do you build a successful enterprise business?” \nbecame public post-mortems by wise investors, sharing war \nstories of promising startups turned catastrophic failures.\nI had the very same reaction to Quora as I did that old \ngaming website where I’d started my very first blog.\n“I can do this,” I thought. “I can beat this game.”\nAt 24 years old, I was far from being an industry professional \nor public figure worthy of enlightening the masses with my \nwisdom. But there were questions on Quora I felt comfortable \nanswering based solely on my experiences in life thus far.\nFor example, I had learned a lot about the importance \nof building positive habits living the life of a bodybuilder \nthroughout college. \nI had learned some hard lessons about life in my early 20s \novercoming substance abuse issues, and going stone-cold \nsober from ages 21 to 26.\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\n10\nIntroductionI had unconventional opinions on the positive impact of \nvideo games after my teenage years spent being a competi -\ntive gamer.\nAnd I had been writing online long enough to know a thing \nor two about online writing.\nI didn’t need to be an “expert” to answer those types of \nquestions.\nI just needed to share my story.\nFor an entire year straight, I challenged \nmyself to write one Quora answer, every \nsingle day.\nI knew that if I wanted to be successful on Quora, then \nI needed to treat it the same way I had treated writing \nonline as a teenager. Worst case scenario, I’d spend a year \npracticing my writing. Best case, I’d build an audience and \njumpstart my career.\nThe questions I chose were ones I felt “qualified” to answer—\nas in, I had some sort of “achievement” I could point to for \ncredibility. For example, the very first question I answered \non Quora was, “Is Elite Daily a legitimate site? Why?” The \nreason I chose to answer that question was because, a few \nyears prior, I had actually been one of the first writers on \nElite Daily when they first opened the site to outside con -\ntributors. I thought, with that small detail as my “credibility,” \npeople would want to hear what I had to say.\nMy first Quora answer received a whopping 37 views.\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\n11\nIntroductionNow, this is where most people would have given up. \nNotoriously, human beings spend an awful lot of time \nimagining the big achievement we want for ourselves at \nthe end of the journey, but struggle tremendously getting \nthrough the beginning—where we suck.\nGamers, on the other hand, know that you have to play \nLevel 1 over and over again in order to reach Level 2. And \nthen you have to play Level 2 over and over again before \nyou can reach Level 3. And if you can just keep on keeping \non your journey, learning and mastering each level, you \nwill eventually climb all the way to the top of the ladder. \nThat’s how you “beat the game.”\nUnphased by my first answer’s perfor -\nmance, I pressed on.\nThe next answer I wrote was to the question,  \n“Should I take a job as an Executive Assistant?”\nEarlier that day, the creative director and one of the Man -\naging Directors of the agency I was working at had gotten \nfrustrated and said out loud, “So many things are falling \nthrough the cracks. I need someone to follow me around \nwith a pooper scooper. I need an assistant.” The other nine \npeople around the table looked down at their computers, \nhoping to hide from being chosen for the job. \nWithout hesitation, I said, “I’ll do it.”\nEveryone looked at me like I was crazy. But I knew exactly \nwhat I was doing.\nThe guy was brilliant. And I didn’t care if my job title was \n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n12\nIntroductionProfessional Pooper Scooper. I knew that by getting closer \nto him, we’d be forced to spend more time together. And \nsince I wanted him to be my mentor, answering emails \nand monitoring his calendar were a small price to pay in \nexchange for all the knowledge I’d receive in return.\n“Done,” he said. “Come with me. We’re going to go land \nsome new clients.”\nI followed him into the next room. He pushed his laptop \nin front of me, handing over his personal inbox, and said, \n“Let’s start with an email to Jamie.” He then paced around \nthe office while dictating an email for me to type to one of \nhis former classmates from the University of Chicago Booth \nSchool of Business—an executive at a publicly-traded \ncompany.\nAfter two hours had passed, dozens of emails had been \nsent, and the day was done, I packed up my laptop, walked \nto the Starbucks down the street on the way to the train \nstation, and answered that question, “Should I take a job \nas an Executive Assistant?” \nIn three short paragraphs, as if reflecting on the day in \nmy journal, I explained the logic behind the decision to \nsign myself up for an assistant job that didn’t pay me any -\nthing extra.\nHere’s what I wrote:\nThis is more of a question of whether or not the person \nyou are assisting is worth your efforts.\nIf they are a master of their domain, then simply sitting \nin the same room as them will inevitably rub off on \nyou in ways that are impossible to quantify on a sheet \n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\n13\nIntroductionof paper detailing job experience—especially if it is in \na field where they will be conversing/communicating \nwith high-profile clients.\nBeing the assistant to someone in that position allows \nyou to see parts of an industry you wouldn’t otherwise \nhave access to. Think about it this way: how many \nyears would you have to invest before they let you sit in \non a meeting with a high-profile client? If you’re their \nassistant, you’re immediately allowed access (pending \nsituation, of course).\nIf this is NOT going to be the case, and you will be \nnothing more than answering phones and regurgitating \nemails, I’d suggest looking elsewhere. But the opportu -\nnity to work closely with someone in a successful  position \nmost often translates into some sort of mentorship —an \ninvaluable opportunity that will end up cultivating \nmore important parts of yourself (confidence, business \nsavviness, professionalism, etc.) than other simpler \ntask-oriented skills.\nThat post got more than 1,000 views.\nI was trending in the right direction.\nOver the months that followed, I started to create a routine \naround taking whatever I had learned that day at work and \nusing it as inspiration for my writing on Quora. Less wor -\nried about whether or not I was the most credible person \nto be answering each question, I focused all of my energy \ninto making my answer the most relatable to whoever was \nexperiencing (or wanted to experience) similar things in \nlife. I tried to think about exactly when  I had learned the \nanswer to each question, what had happened, what was \n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\n14\nIntroductionsaid to me, when it had “clicked,” and then shared that. \nI didn’t need to be an expert on the topic. I just needed to \nbe self-aware enough to verbalize how, where, and when \nI had learned that lesson, too.\nAs a result, my writing exploded. By the end of 2014, my \nfirst year writing on Quora, I had accumulated more than \n3,000,000 views.\nDay in, and day out, I showed up to work, spent all day \nplaying Executive Assistant soaking up knowledge from my \nnewfound mentor, and then would walk to the Starbucks \ndown the street after work to write on Quora. I’d combine \nwhatever I’d learned that day with the larger life lessons \nI’d learned as a pro gamer, or bodybuilder, and write my \nanswer. The more answers I wrote, the more I learned \nwhat topics were resonating with the most people, and the \nmore I started to realize what people really enjoyed about \nmy writing. \nThis was exactly the same lesson I’d learned as a teenage \ngaming blogger: when I wrote about niche topics, viewer -\nship was mediocre.\nBut when I wrote about universal life lessons, my writing \nwent viral.\nJanuary, 2015, I landed on the front page \nof Reddit.\nAs most stories like this go, I really didn’t want to write \nanything that day.\nWork was starting to get more demanding. I was staying \n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\n15\nIntroductionat the office later and later. But I was seeing success writ -\ning every day on Quora, and told myself these were the \nmoments that defined how seriously I wanted to become \na professional writer. \nDid I want it bad enough?\nBefore I left the office that day, I opened up Quora and \nscrolled through my feed to find a question I could answer \nquickly. It didn’t need to be a masterpiece—just something \nso I could say, “I accomplished my goal today.” A few sec -\nonds later, my eye caught the question, “Is it possible to \nchange so much you no longer recognize yourself?”\nIn less than ten minutes, I rattled off a quick response. \nThree paragraphs, nothing fancy. At the top, I placed a \nbefore and after photo: on the left, me as a skinny teenager \nwith an S-curved spine and a concave chest, and on the \nright, me at 25 years old, 180 pounds, completely shredded.\nI wrote about what it was like to be that kid on the left. \nHow I felt sick almost every day of my entire adolescence \n(undiagnosed with Celiac disease). How I was a straight \nC student, didn’t have many friends, and the ones I did \nhave lived in my computer and gaming headset. How I was \nlonely and depressed, thought often about committing sui -\ncide, and couldn’t wait for the day I left for college.\nIn the next paragraph, I wrote about what life was like being \nthat guy on the right. How I had graduated college at the \ntop of my class with a near-perfect GPA. How I had made \nfriends with the “big guys” at the gym and joined their inner \ncircle of bodybuilders and powerlifters. How I had started \nmeditating, gotten a job in advertising, and barely remem -\nbered that kid on the left—skinny, awkward, and alone.\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\n16\nIntroductionI hit publish on the post, packed up my backpack, and \nwalked to the train.\nBy the time I got back to my apartment, forty-five minutes \nlater, one of my roommates at the time found me in the \nkitchen and said, “Dude, did you know you’re on the front \npage of Reddit right now?”\nMy short, three-paragraph post had gone massively viral. \nEvery time I refreshed my Quora profile, I had another \nfew hundred followers and another ten thousand views on \nthe post. By the end of the night, it had crossed more than \n300,000 views. And by the end of the week, it had reached \n1,000,000.\nThat’s when I launched \nwww.nicolascole.com\nKnowing I had a limited window of time to capitalize, \nI spent that entire weekend putting together a personal \nwebsite.\nNot because I wanted to start writing there—but because \nI now had a product to sell.\nWhile my Quora answer continued accumulating hun -\ndreds of thousands of views, my inbox was exploding with \npeople all asking the same questions: “How did you trans -\nform your body? What’s your workout routine? What’s your \ndiet like? How many days per week do you go to the gym? \nHow did you put on muscle as an ectomorph?”\nAs fast as I could, I wrote two eBooks: one with all my \nfavorite workout routines, and another with my exact meal \nplan. I called the series, “Skinny to Shredded,” sticking with \n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\n17\nIntroductionthe before and after photo that had now sparked a massive \ndebate on Reddit as to whether or not I was “juicing” (I’ve \nnever taken steroids, for the record). I designed the eBooks \nmyself. I watched tutorial video after tutorial video trying to \nfigure out how to create a digital store on my new website. \nAnd come Monday morning, the following week, I launched \nmy personal website and first two eBooks.\nI was, technically, an “author.”\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket every time \nsomeone bought a copy.\nSitting in our Monday morning team meeting at work, \nI looked at my phone under the table and saw another \nstring of Stripe notifications. My answer was still going \nviral on Quora, so I’d edited the original post to include \na link to my new eBooks at the bottom.\nThis was how I made my first $2,000 as a writer, and as an \nentrepreneur.\nKnowing this wouldn’t last forever, I tried very hard not \nto let myself get attached to the success of that one article. \nThe likelihood of my next Quora answer landing on the \nfront page of Reddit was close to none, so as soon as the \ntraffic began to die down, I went back to practicing the \nbasics. I stuck with my habit of writing an answer per day, \nevery day—and even though I never wrote another answer \nquite as viral as that one, consistency is what kept me \ngrowing, growing, growing.\nA few weeks later, I had my first answer republished in Inc \nMagazine : “In what ways do you work smarter, rather than \nharder?”\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\n18\nIntroductionA month after that, The Huffington Post.\nAnd then TIME. Business Insider. Fortune. Forbes.\nFrom June to the end of the year, I was averaging more \nthan 500,000 organic views on my writing every single \nmonth, with at least one of my answers being republished \nby a major publication every single week. In November, \nwhen Quora announced their list of Top Writers for the \nyear, one of their moderators sent me a message letting me \nknow I’d been selected—and that I had set a new record \nfor being the fastest user to go from creating an account \non the platform to becoming a Top Writer. In addition, my \nanswer to the question, “Should we ban World of Warcraft \nsince so many teenagers have had their lives ruined?” was \ngoing to be republished in Quora’s print anthology (a com -\npilation of the platform’s most unique works for that year, \nin print form).\nBy the end of 2015, I had become the #1 most-read writer \non all of Quora.\nAs a way of bringing the platform’s T op \nWriters together, Quora hosted a T op \nWriter conference in New York City every \nDecember—and this year, I was invited.\nThe only problem was, I couldn’t really afford to go. Only \ntwo years out of college, I was making slightly more than \nminimum wage as a copywriter, and a single day trip to \nNew York would wipe out all of my savings. Luckily, my \nboss and mentor had taken an interest in my obsession \nwith Quora, wondering how I’d been able to accumulate \n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\n19\nIntroductionmore than 5,000,000 views on my writing while the agen -\ncy’s website blog could barely get more than 50 views per \npost. He had spent the majority of his 20s and early 30s \nliving in New York, said it was the best city on earth, and \noffered to take me there for a long weekend so I could \nattend the conference.\n“You have to go,” he said. “You earned it.”\nA few weeks later, I walked into the low-lit restaurant in \nNew York and introduced myself as “Nicolas Cole.” This \nwas the first time I’d ever said my pen name out loud.\nImmediately, the girl behind the makeshift check-in desk \nrecognized me and said, “You came! We were hoping you’d \nmake it. You’ve caused quite a storm on Quora this year.” \nAfter she handed me my nametag, Quora’s Head of Global \nWriter Relations pulled me aside and said, “Hey, great to \nmeet you in person.” I knew his name because he was \nthe one who had messaged me about my becoming a Top \nWriter on the platform.\n“I’m not supposed to tell you this,” he said, “but we have \nsome internal metrics we look at and I thought you should \nknow. You are the most-read writer on our entire site.”\nIn 2015, Quora had more than 200,000,000 users.\nAttending the T op Writer conference in \nNew York changed my life.\nI got to meet some of the other Top Writers on the platform, \nincluding James Altucher (author of WSJ best-seller Choose \nYourself ), David S. Rose (founder of New York Angels and \nCEO of Gust), and dozens more. I got to meet a few people \n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\n20\nIntroductionfrom Quora’s syndication team, who managed the rela -\ntionships between Quora and all the major publications \nthat had been syndicating my work. I even had a handful \nof other Top Writers come up and introduce themselves \nas huge fans of my writing—while a photographer walked \naround the restaurant, capturing internet peers becoming \nreal-life friends.\nThat night was the moment I realized I was no longer an \n“aspiring writer.”\nI was a writer. \nAnd this was only the beginning.\nA few months later, I was pacing around \nthe office talking on the phone to an \neditor from Inc Magazine .\nThanks to that event, and getting to meet Quora’s team in \nperson, I was ultimately offered the opportunity to contrib -\nute to Inc Magazine  directly.\nEveryone else at the office had gone home for the day. It \nwas just me in my mentor’s office. Staring out the window, \nI knew something big was happening. This was it. My writ -\ning career was about to take off.\n“We expect our paid columnists to write at least four arti -\ncles per month,” the editor said.\nFeeling like I’d been playing in the minor leagues and was \nbeing offered a contract to play in the NHL, I said, “Can \nI write thirty?”\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\n21\nIntroductionSilence.\n“If you think you can write thirty quality articles per month, \ngo ahead,” he said, assuming there was no way I’d be \nable to maintain that kind of output. Inc Magazine  wasn’t \npaying me per article, they were paying me per page view. \nIn their mind, the more content, the better. In my mind, \nthis improved my chances for success.\nNow, most people in my position would have stopped writ -\ning on Quora, graduating to writing for a major publication. \nI didn’t. I had built a massive following on Quora, and was \naveraging more than 1.5 million organic views per month, \nevery month, while still having at least one of my answers \nrepublished by a major publication every single week. I was \non fire, and wasn’t about to throw all my hard work to \nthe wayside. \nInstead, I doubled-down on my daily writing habit, and \ncommitted to writing one answer on Quora, and one arti -\ncle for Inc Magazine , every single day.\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\n22\nIntroductionMy first month writing for Inc Magazine , \nI wrote 30 articles, and accumulated \nmore than 300,000 page views.\nThey sent me a check for $3,000.\nThe second month, I wrote another 30 articles, and \nbrought in more than half a million page views. I made \n$5,000.\nFor six months straight, January to June of 2016, I kept \nup this writing routine—while still working nine hours \nper day as a copywriter, while commuting an hour on \nthe train to and from work, and while eating five meals \nper day and hitting the gym for an hour and a half every \nnight. I worked. I lifted. And I wrote. And then every night \nwhen I got home from the gym around 9:00 p.m., I’d make \nmyself a plate of gluten-free pasta, asparagus, and chicken, \nand work on my first memoir, Confessions of a Teenage \nGamer , until midnight.\nUntil that July, four months later, I decided to quit my job.\nI had already written more than 100 articles for Inc Maga -\nzine exclusively, and became one of their Top 10 most-read \ncolumnists. I was consistently averaging 300,000 views \nevery month on my column, and had proven to myself \nthat I could generate almost all of my full-time income just \nfrom writing online. I figured if I had eight more hours in \nthe day, I could easily make up the rest being a freelancer \nwriter.\nI had dedicated four years of my life to learning the ins \nand outs of marketing, advertising, and copywriting.\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\n23\nIntroductionI had learned a tremendous amount about the business of \ncreativity from my mentor.\nAnd I had built myself into one of the most-read writers on \nthe internet—averaging more views, shares, and comments \nper month than most best-selling authors trying to do \nthe same.\nFinally, I felt ready to take the leap.\nThe same day I left the agency, I also pub -\nlished my first book. \nWith no marketing budget, no publishing house, no PR \nagency, or anything except my Quora audience and my \nInc Magazine column, my first memoir, Confessions of a \nTeenage Gamer,  reached #2 in two separate categories \non Amazon in the first 24 hours. I had invested $1,000 of \nmy own money into self-publishing a professional-looking \nproduct, and sold enough copies the first week to recoup \nmy investment and start turning a profit. \nBut it wasn’t until I started writing about how I was a free \nagent and available as a freelance writer, that I realized \nthe game had changed.\nI’d “beaten the game” of online writing.\nNow, I needed to figure out how I was going to turn all \nthat attention into a full-time income. \nIt was humbling for me to have spent four years on a book, \nonly to release it into the world and sell a couple hundred \ncopies (I couldn’t exactly “live” off $82.76 per month in \nroyalties). I wasn’t discouraged, and my dream was still \n\n--- Page 32 ---\n\n24\nIntroductionto become a successful author, but I needed to be realistic \nwith myself: if I wanted to live in an apartment with a \ndishwasher and a shower that didn’t scream at you first \nthing in the morning; if I wanted to not be so dependent \non needing to write a viral Inc column every month to pay \nmy bills; if I wanted to make more money, so I could have \nmore time to invest in my own writing, my own books, \nthen I needed to find something else in the meantime. \nI needed to play a more profitable game.\nOn accident, I discovered the world of \nexecutive ghostwriting. \nA former CEO who had been following me for a long time \non Quora sent me an email. He’d exited his company a few \nyears prior and was coming out with a business book—\nand wanted to know if I’d be willing to help him build an \naudience for his business writing online. Nothing super \nacademic, nothing overly complicated. In fact, one of the \nthings he enjoyed most about my own writing was how \nconversational it felt. “That style, that’s what I’m looking \nfor,” he said.\nOne client led to two. Two led to four.\nAnd by the end of 2016, my signature “conversational \nstyle” of writing had become the voice of more than 15 \ndifferent founders, executives, and investors—quadrupling \nmy income.\nI was now a six-figure writer.\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n\n25\nIntroductionEarning real money as a writer only moti -\nvated me to work harder, and set bigger \nand bigger goals.\nOne morning, I was eating breakfast at the small table \nbetween my refrigerator and my bed. Above my head was \na rotted bubble in the ceiling that looked like it was about \nto explode with old toilet water. My lease wasn’t up for \nanother few months.\nPicking at my bowl of oatmeal, I looked out of my dirty \napartment window at the tree outside. It had been months \nsince I’d worked on any of my own writing. And even \nthough I still wanted to write my own books, it was hard \nto ignore the opportunity in front of me: in a matter of \nmonths, I’d gone from making $0 as a writer to making \n$3,000 per month writing for Inc Magazine  to making \n$20,000 per month ghostwriting opinion articles for \nexecutives. Furthermore, I’d clearly stumbled onto an \nopportunity very few other writers seemed to know about. \nI’d heard the term “ghostwriting” before, but it wasn’t \nuntil my own clients started calling me their “personal \nghostwriter” that I started to realize the true value of my \nskill set.\nThey weren’t just hiring some freelancer.\nThey were hiring a dedicated specialist who could speak \ntheir language, translate their thoughts, and communicate \nthe stories and insights they were trying to share in an \norganized, articulate way. \nInspired to take advantage of the opportunity I saw, \nI flew to Atlanta to visit one of my best friends from \n\n--- Page 34 ---\n\n26\nIntroductioncollege—trying to convince him to quit his job and build \na ghostwriting agency with me.\nIn his much nicer apartment, I sat at his kitchen counter \nwith my laptop open and explained how I was ghost -\nwriting for executives. “This is a real pain point for these \npeople,” I said. “They have so much insight to share, \nthey’re exactly who everyone would want to learn from on \nQuora, and they’re honestly the people who deserve col -\numns at major publications. They just don’t have the time \nto sit down and write—or, they aren’t writers, and don’t \nwant to invest in that skill set.”\nDrew sat there listening, trying to figure out whether \nI was manically trying to convince him to pursue another \none of my ideas (as I’d done many times in the past), or if \nI was actually onto something. While we’d been long-time \ncollaborators, I’d always been the optimist, and he was the \npessimist.\n“How much money are you getting paid per article though,” \nhe asked. “Fifty bucks?”\nHis guess made me realize how little he, and the rest of the \nworld, understood about the business of writing online.\n“Five hundred,” I said. “And that’s average. I’ve gotten as \nhigh as $1,000 per article.”\n“What.”\n“Yup.”\nDrew sat there letting the information sink into his brain. \nHe’d been complaining to me for months about how \nunhappy he was in his job—which killed me because he \n\n--- Page 35 ---\n\n27\nIntroductionwas one of the most naturally entrepreneurial people I’d \never met in my life, with skill sets very different from my \nown. He was better with numbers, he’d been working in \nsales (selling fractional ownership in private jets to high \nnet worth individuals), and was an incredible designer \nwith a natural eye.\nTogether, we’d be able to build a real brand.\n“Alright, I’m in,” he said.\nWe stayed up until three in the morning \nthat night, strategizing the company.\nWe called it Digital Press.\n30 days later, we crossed six figures in annual recurring \nrevenue.\nAt ten months, we crossed seven figures.\nAnd by the 18-month marker, we had 20 full-time employ -\nees—editors, writers, and a sales team—and had built \na multi-million-dollar business, eventually working with \nmore than 300 different founders, C-level executives, ven -\nture capitalists, angel investors, NYT best-selling authors, \nGrammy-winning musicians, Olympic and professional ath -\nletes, international speakers, and more, helping them share \ntheir insights and personal stories using the same recipe I’d \nused to become the #1 most-read writer on all of Quora.\nAnd now, I want to share that recipe with you.\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n\n28\nIntroductionWho is this book for?\nThere are a wide variety of reasons why someone would \nwant to start writing online today.\nMaybe you’re an author  and want to build a loyal audi -\nence of people who will consistently buy your books.\nMaybe you’re a freelancer  and want clients and custom -\ners to see you as a professional in your field.\nMaybe you’re a speaker  and want to use writing \nas another mechanism for sharing your insights and \nperspectives.\nMaybe you’re an entrepreneur  and want to build credi -\nbility for yourself as a thought leader in your industry.\nMaybe you’re an executive  and understand the value of \npublicly representing your company, its mission, and your \npoint of view of the future.\nMaybe you’re an investor  and want to share your knowl -\nedge and expertise to attract the right type of startup \nfounders looking for funding.\nMaybe you’re a consultant  and want decision makers to \nsee the way you think and hire you to help their company.\nThe list goes on and on.\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n\n29\nIntroductionBy writing online, you elevate yourself. \nAnd when you elevate yourself, you open \nnew doors of opportunity.\nIt took me a long time to realize that writing online isn’t \njust for writers.\nIt’s for everyone, in every industry, at every level—no \nmatter who you are, what you’ve accomplished, or where \nyou ultimately want to end up. By investing in yourself, \nand using writing to share your insights, perspectives, and \nstories with the world, you will end up accelerating your \nprofessional career (and personal growth) in ways you \ncouldn’t have achieved elsewhere. And by mastering “the \ngame” of online writing, you will ultimately reach more \npeople, expand your network, and become an influential \nvoice and leader in your industry.\nI’m going to show you how to play the game, so you can:\n• Accumulate thousands, tens of thousands, \neven millions of views on your writing.\n• Build an audience of loyal, engaged readers, \nsubscribers, followers, and customers.\n• Earn badges of credibility, in the form of \nsocial media metrics, press acknowledgment, \nand so on.\n• Connect with influential people and industry \npeers.\n• Speak at major events, with masterminds, \nand on noteworthy podcasts.\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n\n30\nIntroduction• Write for major publications such as TIME, \nForbes, Fortune, Harvard Business Review, Inc \nMagazine, CNBC , and dozens more.\n• And turn the attention you attract (and \nactively maintain) on the internet into other \nmuch larger opportunities, such as landing \na book deal, a high-ticket consulting project, \nan investor for your company, etc.\nThe reason I know these outcomes are possible is \nbecause I have personally experienced all of them—and so \nhave the 300+ clients we’ve worked with through Digital \nPress, in addition to the hundreds of writers I’ve personally \nmentored over the years.\nSo, how do you do it?\nAnd more importantly, where do you start?\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n\n31Chapter  1\nWant To Start Writing \nOnline? Don’t Start A Blog\nThe first thing I’m going to tell you about the art of online \nwriting goes against conventional wisdom.\nIt’s the first step everyone thinks to take—and it ends up \nbeing their biggest mistake.\nWhenever someone tells me they want to start writing \nonline, their first assumption is they should start a blog. \nWhen they use this word, blog, a very particular image \ncomes to mind: their own website, with their own look and \nfeel, presenting their own thoughts, linearly, post by post. \nThe way most people imagine writing online is still rooted \nin 1995. They think the best path forward is to begin \na “web log.”\nThe truth is, blogging, having your own website, and writ -\ning online are three completely different things. You can \nblog without having your own website. You can have your \nown website without ever blogging. And you can write \nthings online that millions upon millions of people read \nwithout having your own website or your own blog.\nSo, let’s start by defining what those three words \nreally mean.\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n\n32\nChapter 11.  The definition of a blog.\nFor the past 30 years, a blog was seen as a public diary. \nSites like LiveJournal and Blogger were where people \nwould publish and sequentially document their thoughts, \nrants, musings, and more.\nToday, starting a blog is a lot closer to starting a business.\nThe entire purpose of starting a blog, and having people \ncome to your own site, is for two reasons and two reasons \nonly—and both are inspired by money. First, you either \nplan on monetizing your website via ads (which is why \nit’s so crucial that people read your material on your site, \nwhich you own ), or second, you plan on using your blog to \nattract a certain type of customer to your website in order \nto capture their email address and/or sell them a product, \nservice, etc.\nNow, most people hear the above and think, “Well, of \ncourse my goal is to make money from my writing.” But \nmaking money from your writing is not the same thing as \n1) starting a website monetized through ads (which is a \nmedia business) or 2) starting a website that sells a product \nor service (which could be anything from a physical prod -\nuct to an information product like an online course), which \nare all different variations of an e-commerce business.\nEither way, when you start a “blog,” you aren’t really in the \nbusiness of writing.\nYou’re in the business of ads, products, or services.\n\n--- Page 41 ---\n\n33\nChapter 12.  The definition of a website.\nFor the vast majority of people, the primary purpose of \nhaving a website is to quickly communicate who you are, \nwhat you do, and what you have done in the past.\nIn short, it’s a business card.\nA perfect example would be the personal website of an \nauthor and speaker. Let’s say someone says, “Hey, you \nabsolutely have to check out Nicolas Cole’s work. He’s \nincredible.” If you have no idea who I am, the first thing \nyou’re going to do is Google my name. Of all the links that \nappear on the first page, you are most likely going to click \non my website first (since someone’s personal website is \nusually the link that ranks the highest). Once you’re on my \nwebsite, you are going to go through a series of judgments \nin your mind: “What does Cole do? Do I see any symbols \nof credibility? Do I recognize any of his work, or anyone \nhe has worked with? Does this look like someone worth \nknowing about?”\nOnce these judgments have been made, and if you’re still \ncurious to learn more, you’re going to then navigate deeper \nin order to find some of my writing. If I have a blog on my \nwebsite, you might start there—and if I don’t have a blog, \nthat doesn’t mean you’re just going to stop looking. Instead, \nyou’re going to go back to your Google search and start \nclicking on other links in order to find what you’re looking \nfor: my Quora profile, my Medium, LinkedIn, or Instagram \nprofiles, my Amazon Author page, etc. In fact, even if I do \nhave a blog, you’re probably still going to go through this \nresearch process—because what you’re really interested in \nis seeing my writing in the context of how other people feel \nabout my writing too .\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n\n34\nChapter 1Which is why, unless you are an internet entrepreneur \nlooking to build a media business (monetize through \nads) or focus 100% of your efforts on selling a product \n(monetize through e-commerce), I wholeheartedly believe \nstarting a blog is a waste of time.\nAnd to be perfectly honest, even if you are selling a prod -\nuct (as I eventually did), there are far more effective ways \nto get exposure, build a brand, and bring traffic to your \npersonal website than “blogging.”\n3.  The definition of Online Writing.\nThe way I define Online Writing is based on one variable \nand one variable only:\nSharing  thoughts, stories, opinions, and insights on \na platform that already has an active audience.\nIf you’re writing funny restaurant reviews on Yelp where \nthere are millions and millions of users, I would put that in \nthe bucket of Online Writing. If you are an opinion col -\numnist at a digital publication that gets tens of millions of \npage views each month, I’d call that Online Writing. If you \nregularly share industry insights in the form of quick status \nupdates on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook, that’s Online \nWriting. I would even argue that if you are contributing \na guest post to someone else’s  website or blog, where they \nalready have an engaged audience, that’s Online Writing.\n• If you are writing on your own platform \nhoping an audience will come to you, that’s \nBlogging.\n• And if you are bringing your voice to \n\n--- Page 43 ---\n\n35\nChapter 1a platform where an audience already exists, \nthat’s Online Writing.\nThe reason I am so wholeheartedly against blogging as \na writing strategy is because starting a blog means starting \na new website, and starting a new website means starting \nwith zero traffic.\nAnd how do you get traffic to your blog?\nA)   Spend money on ads (direct people from \nother websites over to your website).\nB)   Optimize your blog posts for Search \nEngine Optimization (SEO) so they’ll appear \non the first page of Google when people search \ncertain keywords and phrases.\nC)   Build a social media following on another \nplatform (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) \nand direct people to your website via links.\nBut here’s the thing: none of the above have anything to \ndo with sharing your thoughts, stories, opinions, and \ninsights  at scale. Ads, SEO, and social media marketing \nare very different skills than the art of writing and the \nscience of attracting organic attention.\nWriters don’t typically have an advertising budget \n(I certainly didn’t)—and the ones who do, want to spend it \non something with a more concrete return on investment \n(like selling a product or service). Writers also don’t want \nto spend time trying to figure out how to “growth hack” \na social media following on another platform just so they \ncan funnel people to their blog. Most of all, writers don’t \n\n--- Page 44 ---\n\n36\nChapter 1want to stuff their blog posts full of keywords in the name \nof ranking better on Google.\nWhat writers and industry leaders want is to share their \nknowledge in the right ways, on the right platforms, and \nhave people hear what they have to say.\nWhat they want is to write .\nSo, when should you start a blog?\nThere are two scenarios where starting with a blog is actu -\nally the right decision.\nThe first scenario  is if you are a business selling some \nsort of product or service, and revenue is the primary out -\ncome you are looking to drive.\nNot credibility. \nNot exposure. \nNot building an audience. \nNot industry perception or social reach.\nRevenue tied to a specific product or service.\nHubspot, for example, is a company that sells CRM \nsoftware. Their blog isn’t really much of a blog at all. It \noperates much closer to an industry publication for dig -\nital marketers, and their strategy is to publish so much \nhigh-quality content that if you are searching for anything \nmarketing related on Google, you’ll end up on their web -\nsite, discover their CRM tool, and become a customer. In \norder to do this effectively, Hubspot employs and curates \n\n--- Page 45 ---\n\n37\nChapter 1work from hundreds upon hundreds of contributing writers, \ncreating a content marketing machine.\nIf you are a company with a product or service to sell, and \nyou have the means to create a “digital media company” \nwithin your niche, HubSpot is a terrific use case for having \nan active blog on your website. Your blog should become \nan industry publication, where the purpose of that publica -\ntion is to tap into search traffic around specific keywords \nand increase the likelihood of a reader becoming a cus -\ntomer looking to buy your product or service.\nThe second scenario  for starting a blog is the solopreneur, \nthe digital marketer, the fitness coach, the individual who \nis less concerned with sharing his or her own individual \ninsights and perspectives, and instead wants to use writ -\ning as a marketing mechanism for their internet business. \nThese types of websites aren’t really about the individ -\nual as much as they are the topic (and product) they are \nlooking to sell. Sure, some of the best travel or nutrition or \nfitness bloggers end up sharing a good amount about their \nown lives in the process, but their blog content is primarily \nfocused on providing informative answers to popular ques -\ntions directly related to their product or service.\nOne of the best examples I’ve ever seen is a website called \nKindlepreneur. This is an entire website dedicated to \neducating self-published authors on how to optimize and \nmaximize their self-publishing efforts. It’s an absolute \nbehemoth of a website, insanely informative, and con -\nstructed in a way where if you are the target audience, you \ncan’t help but find your way to the site, devour the free \nblog content, type your email into one of the many opt-in \nforms for more detailed information, and even purchase \none of the products (I did).\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n\n38\nChapter 1The important thing I’d like to point out, however, is that \nwhen I thought to include this example, the writer’s name \nwasn’t what came to mind. What came to mind was Kin -\ndlepreneur, the name of the site—and if you go to the site \nyourself, you’ll see that’s the way it’s presented on the front \npage. Kindlepreneur with Dave Chesson .\nIn this sense, Dave’s blog has almost nothing to do with \nsharing and scaling his own thoughts, stories, opin -\nions, and insights , and is more centered around building \na brand and “ultimate encyclopedia” of knowledge for any -\nthing related to one singular topic: self-publishing.\nIf you are a company with the resources to build and \nscale your website into an industry publication, you \nshould start a blog. And if you are a solopreneur who \nwants to “own” a category or niche by creating a direc -\ntory of knowledge, you should start a blog. But if you \ndon’t fit within either of these two categories, then \nblogging is not your best path forward.\nNow, there is a third scenario  where you can be a suc -\ncessful “blogger.” However, it is an outlier scenario, and not \none I would recommend. Maybe five or ten years ago. But \nnot anymore.\nThe example that comes to mind here is Mark Manson.\nFor those who can’t place the name, Mark Manson is the \nauthor of the bright orange book that took over every \nbookstore from 2017 to 2020, The Subtle Art Of Not Giving \nA F*ck .\nMost people don’t know that Manson started blogging \non his own website, www.markmanson.net, more than \na decade ago (hence why I believe this strategy is outdated, \n\n--- Page 47 ---\n\n39\nChapter 1but I digress). Slowly but surely, he gained a following for \nhis musings related to personal development, and even \nsays overtly on his About page, “Most of what I write is \nwritten for myself, first and foremost.”\nThis is the purest form of blogging.\nWhen Manson crossed over into the world of Online \nWriting was the moment he started using data to inform \ndecisions that brought him outside of his personal website. \nAs the story goes, The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck  was \nactually one of Manson’s most popular blog posts, which \nwas then expanded on and turned into a book (the logic \nbeing: “If millions of people resonate with a blog post on \nthis topic, surely they would enjoy a longer version.”). The \nSubtle Art  went on to become a #1 New York Times  best \nseller with more than six million copies sold.\nThe reason I say Manson’s approach is outdated is because \nnewer, better tools have been created in the past ten years \nthat make the process of building your name, audience, \nand credibility as a writer exponentially faster.\nWhen Manson first started his website and blog, websites \nlike Medium and Quora didn’t exist. You couldn’t publish \narticles yet on LinkedIn. Blogger was still one of the best \npublishing platforms on the internet (and to be honest, \nit wasn’t that good). Facebook and Twitter were infants. \nYouTube was just starting to turn “vloggers” into internet \ncelebrities. And the term “influencer” didn’t even exist yet. \nEvery benefit that came with having a blog a decade ago \ncan now be achieved in 1/100th the amount of time—if you \nunderstand how to play the game of capturing and keeping \npeople’s attention online.\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n\n40\nChapter 1“But Cole, you were selling eBooks on your \nwebsite. Why didn’t you start blogging to \ndrive sales?”\nGreat question.\nIn 2015, after I wrote my first massively viral article on \nQuora and self-published my first two eBooks, I now had \na product to sell.\nThe reason I chose not to pivot from Quora and start \nwriting on my personal website was because I wasn’t \npassionate about building an encyclopedia site for fitness \nreaders. My near-term goal might have been to drive eBook \nsales for my “Skinny to Shredded” series, but my long-\nterm goal wasn’t to build a revenue-generating website \nselling fitness eBooks, fitness programs, and online fitness \ncourses. If that had been my goal, then like the Kindle -\npreneur example, I would have launched something like \nwww.skinnytoshredded.com, writing hyper-focused con -\ntent about fitness, and specifically targeting keywords and \nphrases potential customers were searching on Google.\nAgain, the difference here comes down to what you want \nto get out of your writing. Do you want to build a company \nand brand, making money selling ads, products, and/or \nservices? Then a website and “blog” makes sense. But if \nyou enjoy writing and want to build a personal brand, posi -\ntion yourself as an authentic voice in your industry, and \nshare your thoughts, stories, opinions, and insights at \nscale,  then do not start a blog. \nThe Online Writing approach was made for you.\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n\n41Chapter  2\nThe New Way To Think \nAbout Being A Writer In The \nDigital Age\nData.\nData is the single greatest indicator of what’s working (and \nwhat isn’t working) about your writing.\nWe take for granted the fact that writers haven’t always \nhad access to readily available feedback. If you were an \nauthor in the late 1900s, you had to share excerpts of your \nnovel-in-progress at grungy bars and restaurants hoping \nsomeone would enlighten you with how they felt about \nyour writing. If you were a newspaper columnist in the \n1970s and 80s, you were a bit more fortunate, learning \nwhether the masses enjoyed your column the following \nmonth or week it was published. But it wasn’t until the \nlate 90s and early 2000s that “the feedback loop” started \nto shrink from months and weeks to days, hours, minutes, \nand eventually, seconds.\nThere are 2 types of writers today:  those who use \ndata to inform and improve their writing, and those \nwho fail.\nWhen I was younger, I thought in order to be a true writer \nI needed to go about things a certain way.\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n\n42\nChapter 2I thought I needed to be like the old-school writers who \nslaved away on their manuscripts for years before unveil -\ning their work to the world. I thought I needed to go \nthrough the more formal process of submitting my work \nto a publishing house and then waiting for them to give \nme the approval, the permission , to become a “professional \nwriter.” I thought I needed to walk the path of a conven -\ntional author in order to be successful.\nBut by the time I graduated college with a degree in fiction \nwriting, I had a really hard time believing this tried-and-\ntrue path was still the best path forward. In fact, in my \nlast class of the semester my senior year, our teacher said \nhe was going to explain how we could go about “getting \npublished.” Eagerly, we all pulled out our notepads and \npens and looked at him, ready to hear the secret process \nfor becoming a “professional writer.”\n“The first thing you’re going to want to do,” he said, “is \nprint off a copy of your manuscript.” I wrote that down.\n“Next, you’re going to want to do some research on the pub -\nlishing houses who have published other authors writing \nsimilar things to you, and keep their names and addresses \nsomewhere handy.” I wrote that down too.\n“Finally, you’re going to want to place copies of your manu -\nscript into manila envelopes, mail them to each publishing \nhouse on your list, and then wait.”\nI didn’t write that step down. I raised my hand instead.\n“For how long?” I said, not bothering to wait for him to call \non me. \n\n--- Page 51 ---\n\n43\nChapter 2My teacher—a shy, quirky playwright and fiction novelist—\ndid not like me very much.\n“You wait until you hear a response,” he said, frustrated I’d \njust interrupted him.\n“And how long is that?” I asked again. The look on every \nother student’s face was pure fear. They wanted to know \nhow long they were going to have to wait too.\n“Sometimes it can take up to six months for them to \nrespond,” he said, in that tone parents use when they’re \ntrying to tell you things were hard for them and so they \nshould be hard for you too.\n“SIX MONTHS?” I said. “That makes no sense.”\nThe rest of the class clearly agreed, nodding with me.\n“Well that’s the way it is,” he said, and proceeded to move \non with the lesson. \nAfter I’d graduated, I started researching \nother ways to build myself as a writer on \nthe internet.\nAnd most of what I found was disappointing.\nAll the advice I read was retroactive. The most popular \npublishing strategy was to finish my book or product, and \nthen as I was “preparing to launch,” go ballistic with press \nand ads and blog posts—all of which required a huge \ninvestment of either time or money or both. \n\n--- Page 52 ---\n\n44\nChapter 2In my mind, this approach seemed backward: why would \na writer wait until the moment they were ready to publish \ntheir product to start building their audience? The more \nlogical path forward would be to start writing online, build \nan audience, learn what people actually wanted from you, \nand THEN launch your product.\nSo that’s what I did.\nThe new way to think about being a writer \nin the digital age is to turn your writing \ninto a data mining machine.\nToday, the vast majority of the advising work I do with \nwriters, authors, industry leaders, and companies, is to get \nthem to flip this script.\n99% of people think they know  what they should write \nabout.\nThey think  they know who their audience is. They think  \nthey know what book they should write. They think  they \nknow which part of their story is going to resonate with \nthe most people. They think  they know “who they are”—\nand the brutal truth is, they don’t. They have assumptions. \nThey have educated guesses. But they have zero data that \ncan confirm whether or not they’re correct. And of course, \nthe second mistake they make (after selling their book \nproposal to a big fancy publisher, or retaining a PR firm to \n“amplify their digital presence”) is they think to themselves, \n“It’s time I have my own website. I need to start a blog.”\nThis is why I tell everyone—whether you’re an aspiring \nauthor or the CEO of a public company—that before you \n\n--- Page 53 ---\n\n45\nChapter 2do anything, before you write your book, before you \nlaunch your product, before you think about “positioning \nyourself,” you need to write online.\nWhy?\n• Writing online, first, reduces your risk:  \nYou will learn what people like and don’t like \nmuch faster, for free.\n• Writing online, first, helps you find your \nvoice:  If you start paying attention to data, \nthe way you write today will not be the way \nyou write tomorrow.\n• Writing online, first, builds your audi -\nence from day one:  Instead of waiting until \nyour bigger projects are ready to be shared, \nyou will set yourself up for success from the \nvery beginning.\n• Writing online, first, will give you insight \ninto what people want:  This is what Mark \nManson did that was so brilliant. He used \nthe data from his blog to inform the title, \nstructure, and concept for his book, The \nSubtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck .\nAs soon as I started writing every day on Quora, I started \nto realize how much faster I was learning, growing, and \npublishing on the internet. Anytime I would write some -\nthing online, I would receive immediate feedback—in the \nform of words (“I totally agree! Amazing perspective,” or, \n“You’re an idiot. Go die in a fire,”) and in the form of data \n(Views, Likes, Shares, Upvotes, Comments, etc.).\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n\n46\nChapter 2Without even realizing it, I would then take that data and \nuse it to inform my next piece of writing. I would dou -\nble-down on topics that attracted more viewership. I would \nretell stories that had prompted people to Comment. \nI would adjust my headlines and the format of my articles \nbased on previous articles that had performed best.\nAll of a sudden, I was no longer making decisions based on \nwhat I thought people wanted.\nPeople told me what they wanted—all I had to do was \nlisten.\nThis is your “Writing Data Flywheel.”\nYour “Writing Data Flywheel” is a mechanism for endless \ninspiration.\nThe sooner you start receiving feedback on your writing, \nthe faster you will grow as a writer. The more data you can \ngather, the more insight you’ll have into what people want; \nthe more your writing will resonate; the more people you \nwill reach, and so on.\nLikes  = “This is something I approve of. Nice job.”\nShares  = “This is something more people need to know \nabout. This represents me.”\nComments  = “This is thought provoking. I agree/disagree, \nand I want you to know why.\nViews  = “This strikes a chord. There’s something valuable \nhere.”\nNow, why don’t people like this approach? Why do so many \n\n--- Page 55 ---\n\n47\nChapter 2people insist on pursuing the path to becoming a writer \nthe old way?\nThe answer is because they’re afraid .\nWriting online, and the immediacy of the feedback, \nprompts a high amount of anxiety. It’s the same reason \npeople are afraid to speak in front of a crowd—the feed -\nback is immediate (you can see how people feel by the \nlooks on their faces). But it’s this back-and-forth, this \ninstant reveal that also makes the process so valuable. \nThe faster you can gather feedback in the form of data, the \nfaster you can make decisions to move yourself forward. \nConversely, the more you delay this feedback, the longer \nit’s going to take you to figure out “what’s working” and \nwhat’s not.\nWhich is why I believe it is so important \nto Practice In Public.\nPracticing in public is how you gather that data in the first \nplace.\nMy entire life, I’ve been fascinated by musicians and per -\nformers who rose to mega-stardom. And if you look closely, \nyou’ll find nearly all of them share something in common.\nJustin Bieber  was playing the guitar on the sidewalk sing -\ning full volume before he was even a teenager.\nEd Sheeran  played in subways for years before being \nsigned by a record label.\nThe Beatles  played together six nights a week at a strip \nclub in Hamburg, Germany, before becoming mega famous.\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n\n48\nChapter 2Taylor Swift  played at Rotary Clubs and county fairs all \nover Nashville before becoming one of the biggest artists in \nthe world.\nEminem, 2pac, Notorious B.I.G,  and every rapper before \nthe digital age started by rapping in their local communi -\nties, on street corners and at house parties, before taking \nover the radio waves.\nThe list goes on and on.\nWhat introduced me to this idea of “practicing in public” \nwas really my family. I grew up in a household where there \nwas always a musical instrument being played. Either my \nsister was practicing the violin, or my younger brother was \npracticing the piano, or my youngest brother was prac -\nticing the violin, or the piano, or the guitar. We were all \nrequired to play a musical instrument and to be classically \ntrained.\nBut every time I would sit down to practice the piano, I \nknew that if I repeatedly played the wrong note or chord, \nmy mother would shout from the other side of the house, \n“It’s C sharp! Not D sharp!” I’d then look down at my hands \nand whisper, “You think I don’t know that, Mom.” It was \none of the most frustrating parts of having a constant audi -\nence—and at the same time, it made me a talented pianist. \nIn elementary school, I was playing Beethoven, Mozart, \nand Bach. By middle school, I had graduated to Haydn and \nLiszt. And by high school, I could play entire sonatas with \nmy eyes closed. There was something about knowing she, \nand the other members of my family, were always listening \nthat made me care more about the way I played the piano.\n\n--- Page 57 ---\n\n49\nChapter 2I noticed this same growth process happen when I started \nmy gaming blog as a teenager.\nI will never forget, in one of my first blog posts on the \ninternet, I had used the wrong “their” throughout the \nentire blog. I should have written “they’re.” When I woke \nup the next morning, someone had commented, “You must \nbe a teenager because your sense of grammar is nauseat -\ning. Learn the difference between their and they’re you \nidiot. You should just stop blogging and go kill yourself.”\nWhen I read that comment—well first of all, everybody \ntold everybody to kill themselves in the gaming world so \nthat wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. But when I read \nthat comment, I felt really insecure about my writing. This \nperson had pointed out a mistake I’d made and shamed me \nfor it. But the thought of quitting and never writing any -\nthing ever again seemed even more ridiculous. All I needed \nto do was Google the difference between the two words \nand not make the same mistake again.\nThat piece of feedback was harsh. But it was also the \nmoment I learned the difference between “their” and \n“they’re”—and I remembered it for the rest of my life.\nPracticing In Public is what separates \naspiring writers from professional writers.\nIn life, a lot of people talk about doing the thing they want \nto do. They talk and they imagine and they brainstorm and \nthey keep their work hidden and all the while, they convince \nthemselves what they’re doing is brilliant. They are waiting, \nwaiting for the perfect moment to reveal their amazing work \nto the world—and then, then, everyone will see.\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n\n50\nChapter 2But very few ever exit the “waiting” stage.\nAnd then there are those who don’t hide. They don’t wait. \nThey start and they play their guitar right there on the \nsidewalk and they pay close attention to who smiles and \nwho doesn’t, which songs people stop to listen to and \nwhich ones they ignore. They play and they play and they \nplay so much they could play anytime—they don’t need \nto wait for “the perfect opportunity,” or for the lights, the \nstage, or the setting to be just right. They know how to do \nwhat they do best, simply because they’ve done it so much \nin public—and stage or no stage, lights or no lights, won’t \nmake a difference.\nPeople who don’t Practice In Public are trying to mitigate \ntheir risk.\nThey want the publishing deal to tell them “they’re a pro -\nfessional writer” before they put themselves out there to \nbe judged. They want the press to say, “This is the person \nyou’ve all been waiting for,” before they even step on stage. \nDeep down, they really, really don’t believe in their own \nskills, and so they want to create the perfect scenario \nthat tells the world, “This is someone worth listening to,” \nbecause they haven’t actually gone through the hard work \nof figuring that out for themselves yet. They don’t know if \nthey’re someone worth listening to—because they haven’t \nput their skills to the test.\nI believe the only way to overcome this fear is to run \ndirectly at it.\nAnd it’s in running directly at it that you become the \nperson “worth listening to” in the first place.\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n\n51Chapter  3\nHow The Online Writing \nGame Works: 7 Levels Of \nSuccess\nWriting online is a competition, plain and simple.\nWe can call it art—and it is. We can call it a business— \nand it’s that too. But at the end of the day, the reason \na reader reads one piece of writing and doesn’t read \nanother is because somewhere in their mind, they are \nmaking a choice. And in that choice is a decision to pick \none writer’s work over another.\nWhich means one writer wins, and the other writer loses.\nOn the internet, especially, every single creator—whether \nyou’re a writer, a podcaster, a video maker, a photogra -\npher—is competing for attention. Which means, as a writer, \nyou aren’t just competing against other writers. You’re also \ncompeting against cat videos and viral memes and all the \nother types of content someone could consume in a day.\nUnfortunately, most people don’t see the internet this way. \nInstead, their measure for success is more binary. If they \nwrite a blog post, they’ve succeeded. If they don’t write \na blog post, they’ve failed. If a couple people read their \npost, it must have been “Good.” And if nobody reads their \npost, well, then it must have been “Bad.” And because their \nmeasures for success are so black and white, they tend to \n\n--- Page 60 ---\n\n52\nChapter 3spend money on all the wrong things to drive exposure, \nincrease their audience, and build their credibility: a bet -\nter-looking website, a bigger advertising budget, more PR, \nmore promotions, more, more, more.\nBut the truth is, the real reason most people aren’t success -\nful writing online has very little to do with all the bells and \nwhistles that surround the writing.\nTheir biggest problem is the writing itself.\nThey don’t understand how the game works.\nLevel 1: Conscious vs Unconscious\nMy personal belief is that every single person on the inter -\nnet, whether they realize it or not, is playing “the game.”\nThe game is simple. When you post a piece of con -\ntent—whether it’s a picture of you and your family on \nFacebook, or a video of you jumping into a pool in a bikini \non Instagram, or a link to a New York Times  article on \nLinkedIn—you are sharing a part of yourself at scale.  The \nmore you share, the more people learn about you. The \nmore people learn about you, the more conversations \nhappen, the more opportunities present themselves, and \nthe more a scalable digital version of your real-life self \nbegins to crystalize on the internet.\nNow, some people like to believe they are not playing “the \ngame.” The way they rationalize this is by saying, “I don’t \nreally care what people think of what I post. I just share \nthings I care about.” What they fail to realize, however, is \nthat posting a picture of them and their grandma, and \nan Instagram model posing in front of a lime green \n\n--- Page 61 ---\n\n53\nChapter 3Lamborghini, are the exact same “thing.” They are both \nrepresentations of the creator’s self, expressed digitally. \nThe only difference is: one person is playing the game con -\nsciously, and the other is playing the game unconsciously.\nAnother way of saying this would be “intentionally” vs \n“unintentionally.”\nI’d like to clarify what I’m saying here by reiterating: I do \nnot think every single person on earth should  strive to \nbe a “social media influencer.” I would just like to point \nout that whether we like it or not, we are all playing “the \ngame” as long as we’re on the internet. Which means, \nLevel 1 is all about answering the question, “Am I playing \nthis game consciously? Am I achieving my goal? Or am \nI playing this game unconsciously, and do I not care where \nI end up?”\nSuccessful writers play the game of Online Writ -\ning consciously. Unsuccessful writers play the game \nunconsciously—and then wonder why they aren’t \nsucceeding.\nIf you truly have no desire to be a professional writer, and \nexclusively see the craft as your own personal hobby, then \nplease, feel free to write whatever it is you want to write \nabout. Post it wherever your heart desires (your blog, for \nexample). After all, life isn’t all about “winning”—the \npurpose of life is to play, learn, explore, and express. So \nagain, if all you want is your art in your own corner of the \nweb, by all means, throw this book in the trash and live \nyour best life.\nBut here’s the thing. If you say that’s what writing means \nto you, and only two people clap for what you wrote, then \n\n--- Page 62 ---\n\n54\nChapter 3you aren’t allowed to complain. You can’t sit there and \nblame the internet or “the algorithm” or all the people on \nplanet earth who “don’t know great writing.” You have to \naccept the fact that you’ve chosen to play the game uncon -\nsciously (that is to say, without any awareness or desire \nto pay attention to how readers react and respond to your \nwork), which means you’re stuck in the two-clap club.\nHowever, if your goal is to be better tomorrow than you \nare today, you have to play the game consciously. \nYou have to start opening your eyes to the way the game \nis played, who your competition is, and what they’re doing \nthat is capturing (and keeping) people’s attention—so that \nyou can do the same. \nI’m not asking you to compromise your authentic writing \nvoice for clickbait trash.\nI’m telling you that by playing the game with intention, \nand paying attention to the data, you will discover and \namplify your most authentic writing voice ten times faster.\nLevel 2: Choose A Category\nMost people have no idea what category they’re actually \nwriting in.\nFor example, when you write about yoga, are you in the \nyoga category? Or are you in the comedy category since \nwhat you’re writing about are funny experiences showing \nup to yoga classes? When you write about technology, are \nyou in the technology-tutorial category, because you’re \nteaching people how to use a certain piece of technology? \nOr are you in the technology-news category, because you’re \n\n--- Page 63 ---\n\n55\nChapter 3writing about the impact this technology is going to have \non the industry?\nThe entire—and I mean this quite literally, the ENTIRE—\nart and business and “game” of online writing is rooted in \nunderstanding what category you’re actually competing \nwithin. Unless you can consciously name the category, you \nwill never have a firm grasp as to whether your work is \n“Better” or “Worse” than the competition. It isn’t until you \nunderstand the category, and see “The Ladder” that exists \nwithin your category, that you can begin climbing your \nway to the top.\n*There is another strategy here, and that’s to not compete \nwithin an existing category but create an entirely new cate -\ngory of your own. However, before we get into breaking the \nrules, it’s important to learn the rules of the game, first.\nWhat is a category?\nA category is a frame, a bucket, a spot on the shelf where \nsimilar objects reside. Imagine you walk into a bookstore. \nWhere do you go? Most people aren’t aware of it, but the \nvery first thought they have when they walk into a book -\nstore is, “What category am I looking for?” If they’re \nlooking for a thriller set in a courtroom, they’re going to go \nto the fiction -> thriller -> law category. If they’re looking \nfor a business book about positive workplace habits they’re \ngoing to go to the nonfiction -> business -> productivity \ncategory. And so on.\nIt isn’t until the individual is within a category that \nthey ask themselves, “Who is the single best writer in \nthis category? Who should I read?” If they went to the \nfiction -> thriller -> law category, they would undoubtedly \n\n--- Page 64 ---\n\n56\nChapter 3discover John Grisham. If they already knew and loved \nJohn Grisham, then they would stop their search there. \nAnd if they didn’t like John Grisham, or if they were new \nto the category altogether, they would then start compar -\ning John Grisham to David Baldacci, Scott Turow, and \nso on.\nCategories are how we organize information in our minds. \nKnow your category and you’ll know where readers “fit” \nyou into their own minds.\nCategories are also how we decide what it is we want to \nbuy—or at the very least, give our attention.\nThe exact same mental process happens on the internet. In \nfact, every website and social media algorithm is organized \nby category. Go to any publication and you’ll find thou -\nsands upon thousands of articles organized by category: \ntechnology, lifestyle, food, sports, news, politics, business, \nand so on. On static websites and blogs, these categories \nare created manually by the owner of the site. And on \nsocial media sites, these categories are created intuitively—\nthe more you scroll, the more your algorithm knows what \n“categories” you like, and so on.\nThis is what makes writing online a strategy game.\nThink of every category as its own playing field with its \nown rules. What’s considered kosher in one category may \nseem completely unconventional in another. What one \ncategory calls “innovative,” another might see as boring. \nYour job is to take the time to read, observe, and study \nyour chosen category to the point where you understand \nits native language. You should be able to hear the nuances \nin how people communicate, know which formats have \n\n--- Page 65 ---\n\n57\nChapter 3become tried and true, and most importantly, name the \ndominant writers within the category you are aiming to \nsurpass.\nLevel 3: Define Your “Style” (Where Do  \n You Sit On The Writing Spectrum?)\nAll writing exists on a spectrum, and that spectrum looks \nsomething like this.\nE d u c a t i n g  <<<>>>  E nte r tai ni n g\nOn the left-hand side you have writing that informs and \nexplains (textbooks, news, nonfiction, etc.) and on the \nright-hand side you have writing that captivates and enter -\ntains (true stories, fiction stories, etc.).\nAs you begin to play the game of online writing consciously, \nthe next big question you have to ask yourself is which side \nof the fence are you going to play on? Are you a non-fiction \nwriter? Or are you a fiction writer? Are you an educational \nwriter, where your mission is to inform and explain? Or \nare you an entertainment writer, where your mission is to \ncaptivate and entertain?\nTextbook writers, historians, and journalists exist on the \nfar left-hand side.\nSci-fi writers, pop culture bloggers, and sitcom screenwrit -\ners exist on the far right.\nAnd all along the middle are writers and creators who \nstraddle the line, some educating more than entertaining, \nothers entertaining more than educating.\n\n--- Page 66 ---\n\n58\nChapter 3Creating a unique, memorable, and “different” writing \nstyle is nothing more than a deliberate choice to sit some -\nwhere unexpected on this Writing Spectrum. The more \nunexpected the style, in the context of your category , the \nmore likely you are to stand out. On the other hand, the \nmore expected the style, in the context of your category , the \nmore likely you are to sound like everyone else—and blend \ninto the noise. \nIf you want to know why every company in a specific \nindustry sounds the same, it’s because all their messaging \nis “expected.” But when a new company comes along and \ntheir messaging is “unexpected,” suddenly they stand out.\nThe secret to creating a unique writing style is by doing \nwhat would be considered “unexpected” in your \nchosen category.\nIf everyone in your category is writing restaurant reviews \nas if they’re formal essays, something “unexpected” would \nbe to write comedic restaurant reviews from the perspec -\ntive of a part-time food blogger named Cindy who works \nfor a failing restaurant magazine, and shows up to every \nrestaurant pretending to be this hot insta-famous food-re -\nview writer but actually doesn’t know anything about food \nand gets too drunk at every tasting (and it shows in her \nwriting).\nIn the professional-restaurant-review category, this would \nbe “unexpected.”\nAnd as a result, it would stand out.\nA clear sign you’ve executed this successfully is people \nwithin your chosen category (both readers and writers) \n\n--- Page 67 ---\n\n59\nChapter 3will comment on the unexpectedness of your style. Some \nwill support it, letting you know how refreshing this “new \nvoice” is in the category. And others will feel threatened \nby it, pointing out how it “goes against the rules” that have \nbeen previously defined. As a result, you will experience \nboth positive and negative engagement—again, forcing \nreaders and other writers to make a clear choice: which \nside of the fence do they stand on? Do they support your \nstyle? Or are they against it?\nI cannot stress enough here how impossible it is to know \nthese things about yourself and your own writing at the \nvery beginning. My recommendation here would not be \nto sit at your desk and think endlessly about what your \nunique style is. My recommendation would be for you to \nget started writing, publishing, gathering data, “practic -\ning in public,” and studying The Ladder of your chosen \ncategory. Over time, data will reveal which parts of your \nwriting voice are resonating (and which parts are falling \nflat), and as long as you keep paying attention to the feed -\nback you’re receiving, your voice will continue to grow and \nevolve.\nChances are, where you end up won’t be what you had \noriginally thought people wanted.\nAnd that’s a good thing.\nLevel 4: Optimize Your Writing Style For \nSpeed\nWe can debate all day long about what makes “Good” \nwriting (remember though, “Good” is subjective and an \ninefficient way of measuring effectiveness), but the one \n\n--- Page 68 ---\n\n60\nChapter 3thing I can tell you is the internet does not always favor \nwhat’s “Good.”\nThe internet favors what’s fast.\nWhen people read online, they don’t actually “read.” What \nthey do is skim. Browse. Scroll. They let their eyes gloss \nover the words, and if something compelling catches their \neye in the first two, five, maybe ten seconds (a word, a \nsubhead, a phrase), then they’ll stop skimming and start \nreading. But you better believe as soon as momentum in \nthe writing starts to slow, they’re gone. They’ll swipe back \nto their social media feed and be neck deep in Memeville \nin a millisecond.\nWhen I was in college, one of my teachers used to \nsay all the time, “If your story is reliant on the reader \nmaking it past the first few pages, then chances are, \nyour story doesn’t need those pages.”\nI took that advice to heart when I started writing on Quora.\nInstead of taking the time to give all this backstory, or \nmake the reader wait and wait for me to “get to the point,” \nI would just start with the main point instead. This became \na defining characteristic of my writing style. I would give \na few sentences of explanation or story, and immediately \nmove on to the next point, and then to the next point, and \nso on and so forth.\nMy teachers in college called this, “The Rate of Revelation.” \nThis is the rate at which you reveal new information to the \nreader—and new information is what keeps people inter -\nested. For example, a paragraph with a very slow Rate of \nRevelation would look something like this:\n\n--- Page 69 ---\n\n61\nChapter 3I walked into the kitchen to grab a glass of water, which \nI needed before I could continue writing. I stood there for \na while, staring inside the refrigerator. The kitchen floor \nwas cold under my bare feet, and even though I’d just eaten \ndinner, I found myself eyeing the hummus on the second \nshelf, wondering if I should grab the chips from on top of \nthe freezer and go for round two. I stood there and thought \nabout it some more.\nThat paragraph has a slow Rate of Revelation because even \nthough it’s descriptive, and maybe even entertaining, it \ndoesn’t do much to advance the story forward. In a single \nparagraph this might not seem like the end of the world, \nbut when an 800-word article on the internet has this slow \nof a pace all the way through, you can bet only a handful \nof people are going to have the patience to make it to the \nend.\nNow, here’s what a paragraph with an extremely high Rate \nof Revelation looks like.\nI walked into the kitchen to grab a glass of water. As soon \nas I reached for the glass in the cabinet, it fell to the floor \nand shattered, glass flying into my foot. I screamed, blood \nsquirting out of the tops of my toes. My neighbor, who could \nhear me through the walls, came rushing over, knocking \nfuriously on my door. I yelled, “COME IN AND HELP ME!” \nBut when the door flung open, I turned around and my \nneighbor had an axe in his hand. Before I could say another \nword, the axe soared through the air toward my neck, \ndecapitating my head.\nWhat makes this paragraph “feel” faster is the fact that so \nmany actions  are forcing the story forward. It takes all \nof five sentences to go from an innocent glass of water to \n\n--- Page 70 ---\n\n62\nChapter 3an ill-intentioned neighbor slicing the main character’s \nhead off. That’s a ton of new information packed into \none paragraph.\nBut maybe you aren’t a story writer. Maybe you’re more \nof an information writer (closer to the left-hand side of \nthe Writing Spectrum). Here’s what a really slow para -\ngraph would look like in the writing world of advice \nand education.\nThe one thing everyone should know about habits is they are \ndifficult to build. In fact, habits can take years to develop. \nWhy they take such a long time is because each one of us \nhas a hard time with different aspects of our life, and so \nit can take months, even years, to pinpoint which of those \naspects has the most “bad habits,” and what we can do to \nmake those bad habits more productive. But pinpointing the \nbad habits you want to change is really only the first step. \nIt takes a long time after the fact in order to start seeing \nmeaningful progress.\nPffft. Boringgggggg.\nThe reason this paragraph feels so stale is because it’s \nnot actually revealing anything new to the reader. The \nidea that “habits are difficult to build” is literally the only \npoint being made. You could delete every sentence except \nthe first one and that “paragraph” wouldn’t lose any of \nits value. If anything, it would gain value for the reader, \nbecause now you’re not wasting their time.\nHere’s what a really fast paragraph looks like.\nThe one thing everyone should know about habits is they \nare difficult to build—for four reasons. First, finding the \n\n--- Page 71 ---\n\n63\nChapter 3motivation to break bad habits is easier said than done (and \nare oftentimes used as coping mechanisms for deeper issues). \nSecond, habits can take upwards of thirty days to form, and \nthat’s a long time investment for most people. Third, positive \nhabits don’t always show rewards right away, which make \nbad habits easier to fall back into. And fourth, habits tend to \nbe a reflection of people’s group of friends, which is a much \nharder variable to change overnight.\nMost people aren’t able to articulate why this second para -\ngraph is more compelling to read than the first. Yes, it’s \nmore specific. Yes, it’s “better written.” But the real reason \nit “wins” is because its Rate of Revelation is so much \nhigher. Every single sentence advances the “story” to the \nnext main point. And on the internet, this level of velocity \nis crucial to hooking and keeping a reader’s attention.\nAgain, I’d like to clarify that what I’m advocating for here \nisn’t to “dumb your writing down.” Some writing styles \nactually stand out because of their slow Rate of Revelation. \nAnd so the answer isn’t just to go “faster.” The point is to \nunderstand that the internet moves fast, and then reflect \non the role “speed” can play in your writing style , in the \ncontext of your chosen category.\nLevel 5: Specificity Is The Secret\nOnce you decide to play the online writing game \nconsciously…\nOnce you know what category you’re competing in…\nOnce you see where your style sits on the Writing \nSpectrum…\n\n--- Page 72 ---\n\n64\nChapter 3Once you become aware of your Rate of Revelation…\nThe only thing left to do is be the most specific writer in \nyour chosen category.\nIf you’ve ever found yourself on a company website that \nsays, “We tell human stories,” then you know exactly what \nI’m talking about. Big, vague, all-encompassing phrases \nlack any and all specificity. What people are trying to \ndo when they speak in these overarching terms is try to \n“make something for everyone.” As a result, they end up \ncreating “something for no one.” And because their mes -\nsaging lacks specificity, everything they say sounds like \nwhite noise.\nBeing hyper-specific, on the other hand, forces a choice. \nIt requires the reader to either jump up and down and \nshout, “HELL YES!” or immediately walk away. The title of \nthis book is a perfect example. I could have made the title, \n“The Art of Writing.” Instead, I made the title more specific: \nThe Art and Business of Online  Writing.  Now the reader \nhas to make a choice. Are they looking for insight into \nwriting, in general? Or are they looking for insight specific \nto the digital landscape . Do they want a foofy motivational \nbook about writing, in general? Or are they hungry to \nlearn about the business side of publishing and how to turn \ntheir words into cash?\nThe inverse rule of “Specificity is the Secret,” is   \n“The Broader You Are, The More Confusing You Are.”\nOnce you understand the role specificity plays in highly \neffective writing, you will start to see it everywhere.\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n\n65\nChapter 3• “I want to learn how to cook” is broad.  \n“I want to learn how to cook Chicken Tikka \nMasala” is more specific.\n• “I’m looking to buy a car” is broad.  “I’m \nlooking to buy an electric car” is more spe -\ncific.\n• “I like writing about sports” is broad.  \n“I like writing about basketball and the qual -\nities all great players have in common” is \nmore specific.\n• “She walked into the store” is broad.  \n“She dragged her feet as she walked into the \nbodega” is more specific.\n• “He saved his money every day” is broad.  \n“He saved his money by placing a single \ndollar bill in a shoebox under his bed every \nnight before bed” is more specific.\nIneffective writing is nothing more than writing that does \nnot resonate . And the reason it doesn’t resonate is almost \nalways a reflection of specificity—or lack thereof. Either \nthe writer isn’t being specific enough about their category, \nor the content of their writing isn’t speaking specifically to \ntheir target reader.\nFrom a category perspective, there is a big difference \nbetween broad, overarching categories, and niche cate -\ngories. It’s one thing to say, “I write about life,” and it’s \nanother to say, “I write about lifestyle habits for people \nin their 20s struggling to find their passion.” A lot of \naspiring writers shy away from naming their writing that \n\n--- Page 74 ---\n\n66\nChapter 3specifically, because they fear putting themselves in a box. \nBut especially when you’re first starting out online, a box is \nexactly  what you want. You want  people to know where to \nput you on the bookshelf in their mind.\nThis is how broad categories become subcategories, or \nniche categories.\nBy “niching down,” you will eventually uncover one small \npiece of the overarching category to call your own. For \nexample, one of the overarching categories I write about \noften is Marketing. But there are a lot of different forms of \nmarketing: content marketing, guerilla marketing, Google \nAdwords, Facebook Ads, the list goes on and on. So which \nniche category am I actually competing in? Which “Ladder” \nam I going to try to climb? Instead of trying to be “some -\nthing for everyone” by writing broadly about all of these \ncategories at once, I am better off “niching down” until \nI find one (or a few) categories I can dominate.\nFor example:\n• “Marketing” is broad.  “Content Marketing” \nis more specific.\n• “Content Marketing” is still too broad. \n“Content Marketing For High-Growth Busi -\nnesses” is more specific.\n• “Content Marketing For High-Growth \nBusinesses” is still too broad.  “Content \nMarketing For Founders And Executives Of \nHigh-Growth Businesses” is more specific.\nNotice, the more specific I get, the more I am forcing \npotential readers to make a choice. Either this is going to \n\n--- Page 75 ---\n\n67\nChapter 3be exactly what they’re looking for,  or they’re going to know \nright away I’m not the right writer for them. In addition, \nthe more specific I am, the more I as a writer also gain \nclarity around what it is I’m actually writing about—\nwhich, in turn, makes the reader feel like they’ve found the \nexact writer they’ve been looking for.\nAs you continue to refine which specific category you’re \nwriting in (and this is an ongoing process), you then have \nthe opportunity to bring that same specificity into the \nwriting itself.\n• “Marketing is a great way to build expo -\nsure,” is a broad statement . “Content \nmarketing is a great way to build exposure \nfor your business” is more specific.\n• “Content marketing is a great way to \nbuild exposure for your business,” is still \na broad statement.  “Content marketing is \na great way to introduce new customers to \nyour business and move them to the top of \nyour sales funnel” is more specific.\n• “Content marketing is a great way to \nintroduce new customers to your busi -\nness and move them to the top of your \nsales funnel,” is still a broad statement.  \n“Content marketing, when published by your \nexecutive team opposed to your compa -\nny’s blog, is a highly effective way to build \norganic exposure and trust with your target \ncustomers, moving them through your sales \nfunnel without them feeling ‘sold to,’” is \nmore specific.\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n\n68\nChapter 3It’s this level of attention to detail that makes one writer \n“Better” than another. This is what I mean when I say \n“Good” and “Bad” are unproductive ways of looking at \nwriting. The real question you should never stop asking \nyourself is, “Could this be more specific?” Because the \nmore specific you can be, the more likely you are to reso-\nnate with your target reader MORE than your competition.\nStart within a niche, and then expand from there.\nLevel 6: Engineering Credibility\nCredibility is not the key to becoming a popular writer.\nIf you notice, Levels 1 through 5 have absolutely nothing to \ndo with credibility, perception, status, brand, name recog -\nnition, PR, advertising budget, and so on. They have to do \nwith learning the rules of the game and mastering the art \nof online writing.\nUnfortunately, a lot of people don’t want to take the time \nto learn the game. They’d much rather get to the part \nwhere people know who they are and start giving them \nexternal approval. Especially if the individual has already \nachieved some level of professional success elsewhere, they \nexpect the very first thing they write online to be a mas -\nsive success. They believe their professional status should \nbe enough for people to pay attention to their writing.\nWhen I first started writing on Quora, I had zero credibility.\nI was a 23 year old with long hair down that curled past \nmy ears and practically touched my shoulders. I had a \ndegree in fiction writing, no portfolio, and my full-time \njob was to write social media copy. I was far from someone \n\n--- Page 77 ---\n\n69\nChapter 3“successful” ready to grace the internet with expertise and \nwisdom.\nIn order for me to “win” at the game of online writing, \nI didn’t have the luxury of leaning on my previous suc -\ncesses or professional titles to get people’s attention. I \nhadn’t achieved much of anything professionally. I wasn’t \nsome self-made millionaire or critically acclaimed best -\nselling author. My one claim to fame was the fact that, \nas a teenager, I had been so concerningly obsessed with \nthe World of Warcraft that I had become one of the high -\nest-ranked players in the country. It made for a great story, \nbut that was about it.\nAs a result, credibility wasn’t something I started \nwith. I had to earn it myself.\nLuckily, how you build credibility on the internet is easy. \nIn the simplest way, signals of credibility are nothing more \nthan subtle (or not-so-subtle) signs that you know what \nyou’re talking about and are “worth” listening to. \nThere are three different layers of credibility.\nThe first layer is Implied Credibility.\nYou probably don’t realize it, but whenever you consume \nsomething on the internet, it’s really not the person you \njudge first. \nIt’s the content.\nWhether it’s a video, an article, a song, etc., your very \nfirst judgment is whether or not the material itself reso -\nnates with you. This is how we discover new artists, new \nvoices, new sources of information—and there’s a feeling \n\n--- Page 78 ---\n\n70\nChapter 3of excitement that comes with realizing, after the fact,  that \nthis thing you just stumbled upon is coming from someone \nyou’ve never heard of before. You feel as though you just \nmade an amazing discovery.\nImplied Credibility is how much “Better” or “Worse” your \ncontent is than everyone else’s in your chosen category . If \nsomeone comes across your article or song or video and it’s \nso much “Better”  than the vast majority of other creators \nin your category, they don’t need to read your bio or take \na look at your accolades to know whether or not you’re \nsomeone credible. They’ve already made their judgement. \nYour content is so good , your credibility is implied.\nOther signals of Implied Credibility are:\n• Profile picture:  Right out the gate, if your \nprofile picture is blurry and half-hearted, \nwhat you’re really telling readers is that \nyou’re not “playing the game” seriously—so \nthen why should they take you seriously?\n• Bio: “I like cats, coffee, and watching Net -\nflix,” is not an effective bio. Instead of trying \nto be clever, tell people who you are, what \ncategory your writing is in, and what makes \nyou “credible.”\n• Production quality: If you post pictures, \ngraphic designs, or videos within your \nwriting, then the quality of these content \ntypes are going to speak for you. Low-quality \nimages, for example, are going to tell readers \nyou’re operating on a shoestring budget.  \n \n\n--- Page 79 ---\n\n71\nChapter 3High-quality images, on the other hand, \nlead readers to believe you have the means \nto hire a professional photographer (which \nmeans, “This person must be successful.”). \nIt’s implied.\n• Grammar: There is no faster way to lose \ncredibility with a reader than to have writing \nlittered with mistakes. (However, I too was \nonce a 17-year-old blogger who didn’t know \nthe difference between ‘their’ and ‘they’re.’) \nSo while grammar mistakes can be an issue, \ndon’t let fear keep you from making progress \nas a writer. Just keep getting better as you \ngo along.\n• Organization of thought: If your writing \nreads smoothly, a reader is going to assume \n“you know what you’re doing.” If it’s format -\nted well, they’re going to assume “you’ve \nbeen writing for a while.” These are subtle \nsignals of credibility in the form of expertise.\n• Specificity: Remember, Specificity Is The \nSecret. The more specific you are, the more \nlikely a reader is going to immediately \nassume they are in the right place, reading \nthe right writer for them. \nThis is what makes the “game” of online writing so fun.\nA 23-year-old like me could wake up one day and decide \nto start playing the game. If I am capable of writing “As \nGood” or even “Better” than the best, most credible, most \ncritically acclaimed writers in my chosen category , I can \n\n--- Page 80 ---\n\n72\nChapter 3win. And I can win without spending a single penny on PR, \nadvertising, or “credibility hacking.”\nThe second layer is Perceived Credibility.\nThis is the layer of credibility 99% of people want for \nthemselves.\nThey want to be able to say, “I’ve been featured in Forbes .” \nThey want to hack the Amazon algorithm so they can say \nthey have a #1 best-selling book. They want to sign with \na major publisher to be seen as “professional.” They want \nto take a picture with Tony Robbins. They want a testimo -\nnial from Arianna Huffington. They want as many signals \nas possible to tell people, “I am an incredibly CREDIBLE \nperson,” with the hopes that then people will listen to what \nthey have to say.\nNow, the truth is, these signals do work. There’s a reason \nwhy every company on earth has a banner on the front page \nof their site with a bunch of logos of major publications \nthey’ve been mentioned in. There’s a reason why every big-\nname book has one or two quotes on the front cover from \nother credible people (including this one). These signals can \nbe extremely powerful in getting people’s attention.\nOther signals of Perceived Credibility are:\n• What credible people have to say about \nyour writing: “Nicolas Cole is the single \ngreatest writer of this generation.”  \n–Abraham Lincoln\n• Which major publications your writing \nhas appeared in: “Featured in TIME, Forbes, \nFortune, Business Insider, and many more.”\n\n--- Page 81 ---\n\n73\nChapter 3• How many followers you have on social \nmedia:  100,000 followers sends a signal you \nsimply cannot send with 100 followers.\n• High barrier-to-entry products:  Writing a \nbook, or launching a high-production video \ncourse, are signals of credibility simply \nbecause they typically either require a signif -\nicant amount of expertise and/or money in \norder to execute.\n• Badges and achievements: #1 best-sell -\ning author on Amazon, New York Times  \nbest-selling author, WSJ best-selling author, \nTop Writer on Quora, Top Writer on Medium, \nLinkedIn Influencer, Verified on Instagram \nor Twitter, etc. These are all examples of \nbadges and achievements that can be lever -\naged for Perceived Credibility.\n• How much money you’ve made from your \ncraft: Mystery novelist James Patterson \nis “The world’s best-selling author. His total \nincome over the past decade is estimated at \n$700 million.” That’s Perceived Credibility \non a completely different level.\nHOWEVER…\nWhat so many people fail to realize is that these signals \ncan also backfire—and they backfire often.\nWhen you go to great lengths to acquire and leverage \nPerceived Credibility signals, you are making a promise to \nyour readers. You’re saying, “Look at all these people who \nthink I’m credible. I promise,  you won’t be disappointed.”\n\n--- Page 82 ---\n\n74\nChapter 3If you skip straight to this step in the game (and so, so, so \nmany people do), chances are, every person whose atten -\ntion you capture is going to be disappointed. They’re going \nto know, within the first three paragraphs of reading your \nwriting, whether or not they’ve been tricked. They’re going \nto immediately measure what you’re saying against what \neveryone else is saying in your chosen category . And if it’s \nclear you aren’t quite as compelling as you made yourself \nout to be, they aren’t going to stick around.\nYou might have captured their attention—but you certainly \ndidn’t keep it.\nThe third layer is Earned Credibility.\nThis is the most undervalued form of credibility on the \ninternet.\nIt’s also the easiest to acquire.\nEarned Credibility is nothing more than a signal of expe -\nrience. The way I like to describe Earned Credibility is: \nimagine you stumble across someone’s Instagram page. \nThere’s a clean profile picture. There’s a great bio. And \nthen there are four pictures, all posted from three years \nago.\nImmediately, you are going to think to yourself, “Ah, this is \nnobody.” Their lack of effort, lack of consistency, and lack \nof content tells you everything you need to know about \nhow seriously they’re “playing the game.”\nNow, imagine you stumble onto someone’s Instagram \npage and their most recent picture was posted 36 minutes \nago. You keep scrolling, and you see content going back \nweeks, months, even years. When you scroll back to the \n\n--- Page 83 ---\n\n75\nChapter 3top, you see this person has 6,000 followers. They aren’t \n“Insta-famous,” but they’re certainly “playing the game” \nwith intention.\nYou decide to follow.\nWhether we realize it or not, the reason we choose to pay \nattention to some people and choose not to pay attention \nto other people is not because of Perceived Credibility. It’s \nreally not their fancy titles, badges of approval, or press \nlogos that attract us into their vortex. It’s actually their \nImplied Credibility (quality of content) and Earned Cred -\nibility (proof they’re “playing and winning the game”). \nWhat hooks us is their consistency, their improvement over \ntime, and most importantly, their ability to create some -\nthing that resonates with us in that particular category . \nBy “following” them, what we’re really saying is we believe \nwhat they create tomorrow will be “As Great” or “Better” \nthan what they created today —and we want to be there to \nexperience it.\nOther signals of Earned Credibility are:\n• How long you’ve been creating content \nfor: “Every day for 3 years” sends a very dif -\nferent signal than “I just started last week.”\n• How often you create content:  “I write \nsomething new every day” vs “I write some -\nthing every few months, when I feel like it.”\n• How much content you’ve created:  “I have \nwritten more than 3,000 articles online” vs \n“I’ve written three blog posts.”  \n\n--- Page 84 ---\n\n76\nChapter 3• How many people consume your content: \n“I have more than 1,000,000 views on my \nwriting” vs “I have 300 views on my writing.”\n• How well one of your pieces of content \nhas performed:  If one of your articles has \nthousands of Upvotes, Views, etc., that in \nitself is a badge of credibility—and clear \nproof what you have to say is valuable.\nWhat’s important to note here is that every single one of \nthese forms of Earned Credibility can be acquired for free.\nWhile Perceived Credibility can be bought—you can buy \nmentions in the press, you can buy followers on social \nmedia, you can buy testimonials, you can buy reviews, \nyou can even pay people like me to ghostwrite a book for \nyou—Earned Credibility can’t be bought with money. As \na result, there’s something uniquely different that comes \nwith these badges, in the sense that each is a reflection of \neffort, skill, and self-discipline . And in many ways, these \ntypes of badges actually send more powerful, more trust -\nworthy signals to audience members than even the shiniest \nof more formal awards.\nThe secret is in how you choose to leverage them.\nIt took me a very long time to learn that nearly any sort of \nEarned Credibility badge or achievement can be leveraged \nup to the next. For example, when I was 25 years old and \nQuora named me one of their Top Writers for the year, very \nfew people in the world had any idea what that meant. \nBeing a Top Writer on Quora was a very big deal, but to \nanyone outside of Quora, that badge held insignificant \nPerceived value.\n\n--- Page 85 ---\n\n77\nChapter 3What makes a badge of credibility valuable isn’t really the \nbadge itself. It’s how the writer chooses to wear it.\nAs soon as I became a Top Writer on Quora (Earned Credi -\nbility), I started wearing that badge everywhere. I put “Top \nWriter on Quora” in all my bios on social media. I added \nthe credential to the About page on my personal website. \nI even included the badge in my Quora answers, writing \nabout how I became a Top Writer on Quora in the first \nplace.\nSince I was the one choosing to wear that badge of cred -\nibility proudly, other people started using that badge to \ndescribe “who I was” as a writer. When I spoke on pod -\ncasts, the host would introduce me as, “Nicolas Cole, a Top \nWriter on Quora.” When my Quora answers started getting \nsyndicated to major publications, they would add a line at \nthe end of the piece: “Nicolas Cole, Top Writer on Quora.” \nAnd remember, where they were getting that title from \nwas from my website, and my social media bios.  In 2015, \nmost people didn’t even know what being a Top Writer \non Quora actually meant. But because I was wearing my \nbadge proudly, everyone else took it upon themselves to be \nproud of my badge too.\nThis is one of the unspoken rules of building credibility on \nthe internet.\nCredibility is in the eye of the beholder—and it’s a ladder \nanyone can climb.\nThe moment you have even one signal of Earned Credibil -\nity, you should start leveraging it. If one of your articles \ngets 10,000 views, you should have a link in your bio \nsaying, “Read my most-popular article with more than \n\n--- Page 86 ---\n\n78\nChapter 310,000 views.” If something you write gets Tweeted by \na prominent person in your industry, use that to your \nadvantage: “Mark Cuban loved this article of mine—I think \nyou will too.” If you’ve been writing online for five years \nstraight, why isn’t that in your bio? “Writing every single \nday online since 2015. Read my most-popular articles here.”\nThere are an infinite number of credibility signals that \nexist on the internet.\nUnfortunately, most writers don’t use these signals to their \nadvantage. They have them, or they very easily could have \nthem, they just choose not to leverage them.\nAs a result, they don’t “appear” very credible at all.\nLevel 7: Create Your Own Category\nOnce you’ve made it through Levels 1 through 6, you will \nunlock the most important realization of your entire writ -\ning career.\nCompeting in other people’s categories sucks.\nIt’s actually very, very difficult to become the “Category \nKing” of someone else’s category. What I mean is, let’s say \nyou want to write horror stories. How are you ever going to \nbe seen as “Better” at writing horror stories than Stephen \nKing (no pun intended). Or let’s say you want to write legal \nthrillers. How are you ever going to be seen as “Better” \nat writing legal thrillers than John Grisham? Or, here’s a \ngood one. Let’s say you want to write a young adult fiction \nstory about witchcraft and wizardry. HOW ARE YOU EVER \nGOING TO BE SEEN AS “BETTER” AT WRITING ABOUT \nA MAGIC SCHOOL FOR KIDS THAN J.K. ROWLING?\n\n--- Page 87 ---\n\n79\nChapter 3You’re not.\nYou could get a few readers, maybe. You could even, one \nday, way down the road, become the second-best writer \nin that specific category . But the chances of you actually \nsurpassing that “Category King,” and being seen as “THE \nBEST” is highly unlikely.\nSo, what’s a writer to do?\nThe answer is to create a new category of your own.\nWhat I am about to share with you is the most under-dis -\ncussed aspect of writing, and yet it is also the secret to \nwhy some writers miraculously “come out of nowhere” and \nbecome massive success stories—and others sound like the \nsame old, same old.\nMega-successful writers (in both big ways, like selling \nmillions of copies of books, and small ways, in going viral \non the internet), don’t compete  within existing categories. \nWhat they do, intuitively, accidentally, or intentionally,  is \ncreate a new category for themselves.\nFor example:\n• “Pop Science”: Before Malcolm Gladwell, \nmost non-fiction writers either wrote about \nscience-backed material in a very formal, “high -\nfalutin” sort of way, or they avoided the science \naltogether and just wrote general life advice. \nGladwell, instead of competing in either of \nthese two categories, created his own—which \nthe media has since referred to as “Pop Science.” \nHis books are based on thorough research, but \nthey’re written for a non-academic audience.\n\n--- Page 88 ---\n\n80\nChapter 3• “Wizardry For Kids”: J.K. Rowling came \nalmost fifty years after J.R.R Tolkien, and \nyet instead of trying to write a “Better” ver -\nsion of The Lord Of The Rings , she created a \ncompletely different category of “fantasy and \nmagic” by writing a story intentionally aimed \nat younger readers. \n• “No-Bullshit Self-Help”: The Self-Help indus -\ntry over the years has been niched a gazillion \ndifferent ways, but it wasn’t until Jen Sincero \npublished You Are A Badass , and Mark Manson \npublished The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A \nF*ck, that a whole new niche emerged: telling \npeople how to un-fuck their lives, plain and \nsimple. All of a sudden, readers had to make \na choice. Were they looking for a nice, calm, \nfriendly self-help book (category), or were they \nlooking for a no-bullshit guide to self-im-fuck -\ning-provement (new category)?\n• “Fratire”:  Before Tucker Max’s, I Hope They \nServe Beer In Hell , there was “satire,” and there \nwere fraternity stories told around bonfires \nwhile drinking Natty Light. And in the begin -\nning, a lot of people misunderstood why Max’s \nbook series caught fire. Was it because they \nwere funny? Yes. Were they well written? \nThat’s a subjective question. The real reason \nMax became a #1 New York Times  best-selling \nauthor was because he had created a com -\npletely new category—and one no one else \ncould enter without being immediately com -\npared to Max and his debaucheries.\n\n--- Page 89 ---\n\n81\nChapter 3The list goes on and on.\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of writers don’t create \ntheir own categories. To be honest, most don’t even know \nthey can—let alone how.\nInstead, what they do is they spend their entire lives trying \nto compete in someone else’s category. From the moment \nthey decide they want to become a writer, they look at \nsomeone else and think, “That’s who I want to be.” The \nirony is, in wanting to be like  another writer, they trick \nthemselves into playing a flawed game. They set out to try \nto be a “Better” version of a writer within an existing cate -\ngory, instead of creating a new and “DIFFERENT” category \naltogether.\nAs a result, they spend their entire writing career in some -\none else’s shadow.\nAs writers, we all start out imitating each other, wanting to \n“be like” the person who inspired us to write. But at a cer -\ntain point, once the fundamentals have been learned and \nthe lessons have started to crystalize, a fork in the road \npresents itself. “Do I want to keep trying to be a ‘Better’ \nversion of someone else? Or is it time I become a new and \nDIFFERENT version of myself?”\nAnd DIFFERENT always beats “Better.”\nSo, how do you create a category?\nCategories are created at unlikely intersections,  spot -\nted by writers with an intimate understanding of one or \nmultiple sub-categories.\n\n--- Page 90 ---\n\n82\nChapter 3There are a million different ways to create a category, but \nit’s easiest to think about category creation as a matching \ngame.\nYour job as a writer—once you’ve found your strengths, \nyour high-performing topic areas (validated by data), and \nwhere you prefer to sit on the Writing Spectrum—is to \nmatch different audiences, genres, and writing styles to \ncreate a new and DIFFERENT category.\n• AUDIENCE x GENRE: Let’s say you’re \na history buff, and you love writing historical \nfiction. The only problem is, adult historical \nfiction has a ton of competition. That’s a \nmassive category, and a tough one for you to \ncompete in. So, leaving the genre the same, \nhow can you adjust the AUDIENCE to make \nthe genre something entirely new? An exam -\nple of this would be: historical fiction for kids , \nor historical fiction for war veterans , or his -\ntorical fiction for immigrants ? These might \nsound like “small” categories, but remember, \nSpecificity Is The Secret. By going all-in on a \nnew and DIFFERENT category, you are forc -\ning readers to make a choice. If you’re a war \nvet and you love historical fiction that doesn’t \nread like bubblegum but speaks in the lingo \nonly a true war vet would understand, that \ngenre is going to be your JAM.\n• GENRE x GENRE: Take two genres that \ndon’t typically go together and all of a \nsudden you might have an interesting new \ncategory on your hands. What would it \nlook like to combine the sci-fi genre with \n\n--- Page 91 ---\n\n83\nChapter 3the memoir genre? Or what about the How \nTo genre with the fiction genre? The more \nunexpected the pairing, the more likely it is \nfor you to stumble onto something radically \nDIFFERENT and uniquely interesting.\n• AUDIENCE/GENRE x TONE: In one cate -\ngory, where you sit on the Writing Spectrum \ncould be expected and boring. But in a \ndifferent category, it could be exciting and \nrefreshing. Jen Sincero’s, You Are A Badass , is \na terrific example of how a tone shift created \na whole new niche in the Self-Help category. \n(Ask most people, though, and they’ll say, \n“The book was popular because it had a great \ntitle” or “It was really well written.” They fail \nto see the category it created, and the choice \nit forced readers to make: “Do I want to \nread a self-help book that sounds warm and \ncomforting? Or do I want to read a self-help \nbook that slaps me in the face and tells me to \nwake the fuck up?”).\nOnce you’ve created a new and DIFFERENT category in \nyour mind, you must then communicate the differences of \nthat category to your audience. This is what’s called your \n“Point of View.” Your POV is the way you see the world, the \nunique vantage point that allows everyone else to under -\nstand your perspective.\nWhat is your new category and why is it different?\nThe idea here is to educate readers on how this new cat -\negory is nothing like other nearby categories. One of \nmy favorite examples here is the category of “military \n\n--- Page 92 ---\n\n84\nChapter 3romance.” Somewhere along the line, a writer woke up in \nthe morning and thought, “You know, romance is a pretty \nbig category. But I bet there are readers who only want to \nread romance novels in military settings.” All of a sudden, \nyou as a reader have to make a very concrete choice: do \nyou want to read any romance novel? Or do you want to \nread a romance novel where the main character is in the \nmilitary? \nThis is where, again, Specificity Is The Secret. The more \nspecific you can be about why your new category is exactly \nwhat your target readers are looking for, the more likely \nit is readers will see this category of yours as unique and \nSEPARATE from any and all competition. Notice: I am not \ntalking about your “brand” as a writer, or the title of your \nbook, eBook, article, etc. I’m talking about marketing the \ndefining characteristics of the category itself—leading \nreaders to ask the most important question of all. “If this is \nthe category I’m interested in, then who should I be read -\ning? Who is the #1 writer here?”\nAnd if you’re the one who created and educated them on \nthis new category, who are they going to see as the expert?\nThat’s right.\nYou.\n\n--- Page 93 ---\n\n85Chapter  4\nWhere You Should Be \nWriting Online—And Where \nYou Should Not\nThe digital landscape is always changing.\nWhere you should be writing online today is not necessar -\nily where you should be writing online tomorrow. In an \nattempt to make this book more “timeless” than “timely,” \nI’m going to focus this chapter more on the attributes  of \nwhere you should be writing online, more so than recom -\nmending tips and tricks that may work today but won’t last \nforever.\nAt the beginning of this book, I defined Online Writing as \n“…sharing thoughts , stories, opinions, and insights  on \na platform that already has an active audience.”\nMost aspiring writers, industry thought leaders, business \nowners, consultants, public speakers, and digital marketers \nthink this means writing for a major publication.\nWhy?\nBecause having a Forbes  logo at the top of your article is \ninstant Perceived Credibility.\nAnd yes, while contributing to a major publication does \nhave its benefits in the world of online writing, it’s far from \n\n--- Page 94 ---\n\n86\nChapter 4the “holy grail” people make it out to be. As someone who \nwrote for Inc Magazine  for almost three years, and became \none of their most popular writers, I want to pull back the \ncurtain and debunk five myths about how much “exposure” \npublications really give their writers.\n1.  Writing for (or being featured in) \na major publication does not automati -\ncally guarantee “millions of views.”\nPeople love data, so let me give you some data.\nOf the 409 columns I wrote exclusively for Inc Magazine , \nonly 44 of them exceeded 10,000 views in 2017.\n• 28 of them were 10,000 to 19,000 views.\n• 5 were 20,000 to 29,000 views.\n• 4 were 30,000 to 39,000 views.\n• 2 were 40,000 to 49,000 views.\n• 2 were 50,000 to 59,000 views.\n• 1 was 90,017 views.\n• 1 was 128,041 views.\n• And 1 was 133,000 views.\nSo, just because “all of Inc Magazine ” gets 30 million views \nper month, does not mean your one article is going to get \neven a meaningful fraction of that.\nAnother unfortunate stat is that the average amount of \n\n--- Page 95 ---\n\n87\nChapter 4time a reader spends reading an article on a major publi -\ncation is less than 60 seconds—with a 70-90% bounce rate \n(meaning once a reader starts reading an article on a major \npublication, less than 10% click to read a second).\nThis is because the vast majority of major publications \nmonetize through advertising. Their entire model is to \nshove as many ads down the reader’s throat before they \nrun away. The name of the game is to then spend less on \nthe cost of getting you to click than the profit generated on \nthe ads shown to you within that sixty-second window.\nAs a result, publications are not built for prolonged reading \nexperiences. Instead, they’re optimized for SEO (articles \nthat rank well in search results around industry specific \nkeywords) or “clickbait” headlines that can grab people’s \nattention on social media—either organically or via paid \nmedia. In all three of these scenarios, a user is discovering \na single article, clicking to read, and then returning back \nto wherever they were before.\nWhat all of this means is writing one single article guar -\nantees almost nothing in terms of exposure. In fact, the \nmajority of the traffic an article receives will be based \non your sharing it on your own social media—with the \nprimary benefit being your saying, “Check it out! I wrote \nsomething for Forbes !” and a handful of your Facebook \nfriends and LinkedIn connections hitting Like and com -\nmenting congratulations.\n2.  When you write for a major publication, \nyou don’t have the freedom to write what -\never it is you want to write about.\n\n--- Page 96 ---\n\n88\nChapter 4Think of yourself as an employee.\nWhen major publications are looking for contributing writ -\ners or columnists, what they’re really looking for is volume \nwithin an under-resourced category .\nThe real reason I landed my own column with Inc Mag -\nazine  wasn’t just because I was an effective writer. The \nreason was because, at the time, Inc was looking for more \nwriters within their Creativity category. As I began writing \nfor the site and bringing in hundreds of thousands of page \nviews, sure, they allowed me to deviate from just writing \nabout creativity—because I was clearly a net-positive writer \nfor the publication. But every few months, I would hop on \na call with my editor, and they would inevitably end up \ntrying to steer me back into my lane, recommending topics \nthey needed more writers covering.\nI “worked” for them.\nIf your goal is to write about the things you want to \nwrite about, don’t bother writing for a publication.\nWhen I started ghostwriting for executives—and I’m talking \nvery, very successful business leaders; the kind who had \nbrought companies public and/or exited for hundreds of \nmillions of dollars—I helped many of them land columns \nof their own. And while you’d think that business and news \npublications would give people like this more freedom, they \nwere still subject to the same scrutiny. I remember one \neditor telling this executive I had been working with for \nalmost two years that one of his articles wasn’t being objec -\ntive enough. This was in 2018, when GDPR (General Data \nProtection Regulation) became enforceable in Europe and \nwas having a dramatic impact on this guy’s international \n\n--- Page 97 ---\n\n89\nChapter 4business. The article we wrote together was about how com -\npanies needed to think about navigating this new law, and \nnot get fined by the government.\nBut this editor wanted him to write as if he was a jour -\nnalist, not a seasoned executive talking about his own \nbusiness.\nIn order to keep his column, he had to play by their rules.\n3.  Writing for a major publication does \nnot mean you get to promote yourself all \nday long.\nThe average column on a major publication receives less \nthan 1,000 views.\nLet me say that again:\nThe average column on a major publication receives \nless than 1,000 views.\nThe articles that “go viral” only fall into three categories:\n• They are about an insanely successful com -\npany (Apple).\n• They provide an unexpected perspective on \na controversial and trending topic.\n• They focus on personal development/life \nadvice.\nOut of my top 10 performing columns of 2017 for Inc \nMagazine , 9 had to do with personal development. The one \n\n--- Page 98 ---\n\n90\nChapter 4that had to do with a company was about Facebook in the \nnews.\nI can’t tell you how many authors, business owners, and \npublic speakers think “if only” they could write for a major \npublication, then they would be able to promote their \nbusiness or their book and all would be right in the world. \nWhat they don’t take into consideration, however, is that \npeople don’t wake up in the morning excited to read about \nyour best interests.\nPeople read major publications for three reasons:  \nopinions, news, or to learn how to do something. \nThat’s it.\nThe fact that my top 10 highest-performing articles are \npredominantly about personal development should tell you \nsomething. These weren’t articles about me—these were \narticles about you, the reader. These were pieces to get you \nthinking, to make you more productive, to help your life in \nsome way. And it was because I was putting the reader first \nthat my articles performed so well. Anytime I shifted the \nfocus to myself, or leaned too heavily into my own “navel \ngazing,” viewership fell.\nAll of my most popular Quora answers followed a sim -\nilar methodology.\n• 800,000+ views: How to become more con -\nfident.\n• 783,000+ views: How to stop being average.\n• 507,000+ views: What it feels like to go from \nunattractive to attractive.\n\n--- Page 99 ---\n\n91\nChapter 4• 425,000+ views: A stranger I met once that \nchanged my life forever.\n• 412,000+ views: Why having everything you \nwant won’t make you happy.\n4.  Social platforms will always exceed \nmajor publications in terms of reach.\nThere are times when articles on major publications will \ngo viral and accumulate millions, tens of millions, even \nhundreds of millions of views.\nBut these are rare moments. And not only are they rare, \nbut they usually don’t favor thoughtful articles intended for \na well-educated reader. The most viral articles for publi -\ncations are pieces like, “No, Megyn Kelly Should Not Have \nWorn That Dress” (one of Inc’s most popular articles in all \nof 2016), or slideshow articles on Business Insider about \nJeff Bezos’s net worth measured in rice.\nSocial platforms, on the other hand, tend to be more gener -\nous to a wider range of writers.\nNumbers alone tell the story. Inc Magazine  averages \naround 30 million page views per month. Medium, a \nsocial writing platform, has somewhere around 30 million \nusers—and Quora is about 10x the size of Medium, with \n300 million users.\nSide by side, my Inc column never once outperformed \nmy exposure on Quora or Medium.\nA really great month writing for Inc Magazine , I’d bring in \n300,000 views.\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n\n92\nChapter 4On Medium though, 300,000 views in a month was consid -\nered average.\nAnd between 2014 and 2018 on Quora, 300,000 views was \nconsidered a monumental failure. I consistently averaged \nover a million.\nEven still today, my Inc Magazine  reports tell me my 409 \ncolumns continue to generate around 80,000 views per \nmonth, passively. Meanwhile, my content on Medium and \nQuora together generates between 500,000 and 1,000,000 \nviews per month passively.\nPublications “seem” big, but in reality, their distribution is \nrather small.\n5.  On major publications, you don’t “own” \nyour own audience.\nFinally, the biggest thing to think about before pledging \nyour allegiance to a major publication is how much control \nyou want over your content.\nWhen you write for a publication, all your control goes \nout the window. Once an article goes live, it’s not yours \nanymore—it belongs to the site. After a certain period of \ntime ( Inc requires a week, Forbes  asks for two weeks, etc.), \nyou’re allowed to republish the article on your website, \nyour blog, social media, etc., as long as you provide a link \nat the bottom stating, “This article was originally published \non Inc Magazine .”\nIn addition, very little is done for you (the contributing \nwriter or columnist) to capture your readers. There is no \n“follow” button on your column. There is no mechanism \n\n--- Page 101 ---\n\n93\nChapter 4for you to ask readers to type in their email and subscribe. \nEven the data most major publications give their writers \nis limited. At best, you’ll know how many views an article \nreceived, and what the major referral traffic sources were \n(for example: 78% of readers came from Facebook ). But as \nfar as demographic data, or engagement data, there really \nisn’t any—and as a writer, this is the data you need to \ngather most.\nAs a contributing writer, your job is to produce page \nviews for the publication. In return, you get to leverage \nthe name of the publication for your own Perceived \nCredibility.\nHowever, that’s not to say there aren’t benefits to contrib -\nuting content to these major publications. Writing for Inc \nMagazine  had a dramatic impact on my career as a writer. \nIt gave me a different sort of credibility than Quora or \nMedium could, simply because there was a barrier to entry. \n“Not everyone” could contribute to Inc, which is what made \nit special.\nHere are the benefits that come with contributing content \nto a major publication:\n• Perceived Credibility:  Once you write even \none article for a publication, you can now say, \n“Published in…XYZ.” You can place their logo \non your website. You can use that one article as \nleverage to land more articles in more places. For \nexample, I have only had two articles in TIME—\nand yet I can still say, “Published in TIME.”\n• SEO: Major publications have extremely high \ndomain authority, meaning that if a page on \n\n--- Page 102 ---\n\n94\nChapter 4Inc Magazine  or Forbes  links to another web -\nsite, that weighs heavily in Google’s search \nalgorithms. As an author, not only will \nboth your column and bio link to your own \npersonal or company website (telling Google \nit is credible and thereby pushing it up the \nrankings), but you can also find creative \nways to link to your website(s) within your \narticles, further boosting your own SEO. If \nyou want to see what this looks like in action, \nsearch “Nicolas Cole” into Google and you’ll \nsee I own the entire first 3+ pages of results. \nThe reason is because I have hundreds of \narticles, across dozens of publications I’ve \ncontributed to, all linking back to my per -\nsonal website, my social platforms, etc.\n• Social Exposure: For the last year of my \nwriting for Inc Magazine , the biggest bene -\nfit I got out of my column was the fact that \nevery time one of my articles went live, their \nTwitter account (with 2.7 million followers) \nwould Tweet my latest article and tag me. \nSince I was writing 5+ columns per week, \nI was getting Tweeted by Inc’s Twitter con -\nstantly—which is how I built my own Twitter \nfollowing of 7,500+ readers (many of whom \nare journalists, other columnists, business \nleaders, investors, marketers, writers, and so \non). If you write often enough for a publica -\ntion, and they regularly feature your work on \ntheir social profiles, this can be a powerful \ndriver for your own audience growth. How -\never, not every publication does this, and \n\n--- Page 103 ---\n\n95\nChapter 49 times out of 10, they only promote their \nmost popular contributing writers.\n• Money: If you are a consistent writer look -\ning for a side hustle, writing for a major \npublication isn’t a bad pursuit. But in order \nto even be considered as a paid contributing \nwriter, you need to 1) already have proven \nyour ability to drive viewership elsewhere \n(I did this on Quora), 2) be a credible source \nof information in your chosen category, and \n3) guarantee you can write a certain number \nof articles for the site per month. If you fall \nbelow that quota, you won’t get paid. If you \nmeet your quota or exceed it, most major \npublications will pay per page view and \nnot per piece. This is in the best interest of \nthe publication, in the sense that the writer \nonly makes money if the publication makes \nmoney (since page views = ad revenue). \nHowever, in order to make any money at \nall using this model, you need to be author -\ning an obscene amount of content—or you \nneed to get extremely lucky. Some months, \nI would write twenty-five or thirty articles \nand only make a few hundred dollars (which, \ndivided by the number of hours spent \nwriting, meant I was making far less than \nminimum wage), and other months, I would \nwrite a home-run viral article and get \na check for $5,000. One of my closest friends, \nwho I also helped land a column with Inc, \nwrote one of the publication’s most viral \narticles of all time, accumulating more than \n\n--- Page 104 ---\n\n96\nChapter 420,000,000 views in a single month. They \nhad to cut him a check for $20,000, which \nhe then used to buy a diamond ring and \npropose to his girlfriend (true story). If this \nsounds like the equivalent to winning the \nlottery, that’s because it is. The vast majority \nof contributing writers don’t get paid at all, \nsimply because the volume they produce isn’t \nenough to warrant paying them.\nIf you’re a fiction writer, or a fitness writer, or any other \ntype of writer, all these same rules apply. Even in the world \nof literature, short story publications play by very similar \nrules (just with less money at their disposal). Travel, food, \nand pop culture websites, same thing. All you need to \nknow is that the primary benefit of writing for a publica -\ntion is the Perceived Credibility that comes with it—and \nmany, if not all of these sites use this to their advantage. \nYou write for free, and in exchange you get to leverage \ntheir logo for your own credibility. And while the other \nbenefits, such as SEO, social exposure, and money can \ncertainly be nice, there are far better ways to achieve those \nsame ends without having to play the role of “opinion jour -\nnalist” for a publication or industry website.\nWhich is why I firmly believe the single best place to begin \nwriting online is on some sort of social media platform.\n\n--- Page 105 ---\n\n97\nChapter 4The 5 Phases of Social Platforms—  \nAnd Why Phase 3 Is Your Window of \nOpportunity\nBefore you can even begin entertaining the thought of \nwriting for a major publication, let alone authoring a book, \nyou still need to go through the steps of figuring out your \ncategory, discovering what makes your voice unique, and \nproving your writing has an audience.\nIn order to do these three things as quickly as possible, it’s \nbest to begin writing on a social media site that 1) already \nhas a significant user base, 2) is relevant to your chosen cat -\negory , and most importantly, 3) provides you with analytics \ninto your target readers’ behaviors. This is where writing on \nyour own blog, or even someone else’s website, falls short. \nThe whole idea isn’t to just hit publish and then pat yourself \non the back. The idea is to hit publish and start gathering \ndata. What are people Liking? What are people Upvoting? \nWhat are people Commenting? What are people Sharing?\nThese are the signals that will start to direct your writing \nstyle, and tell you whether you should go right or left.\nPros of writing on a social platform:\n• Readers can easily discover you (whereas with \na blog you are responsible for bringing the read -\ners yourself, and with a publication you are \nhoping people will discover you via SEO and/or \npaid media).\n• You can “earn” credibility with metrics like Views, \nShares, Comments, Badges, Who-Follows-Who, etc.\n\n--- Page 106 ---\n\n98\nChapter 4• You can interact and build meaningful rela -\ntionships with other writers and readers.\n• You can build an audience, faster, in an \nenvironment that allows you to reach them \nquickly and effectively.\n• You still “own” all of your content. Unlike \nwriting for a major publication, you can \ndo whatever you want with your content—\nincluding copy/pasting the exact same \nmaterial onto different platforms.\n• You are perceived differently. When some -\none reads your writing on your blog, it feels \nbiased and subjective. When someone reads \nyour writing on a social site, it feels more \nobjective and “out in the open.”\n• Your content is more likely to be shared. \nOther websites and publications very rarely \n(if ever) syndicate or share content from \nsomeone’s personal blog or company website. \nBut content published in social environments \nis considered “fair game” and far more likely \nto be shared. Social platforms also have \nexponentially larger audiences than websites \nand publications, so when a piece of writing \n“catches fire” on a social site, it goes further, \nfaster.\n\n--- Page 107 ---\n\n99\nChapter 4Cons of writing on social platforms:\n• Feedback is much more immediate. (This is \nactually a pro, but for a lot of people it’s seen \nas a con. They don’t like the idea of writing \nin an environment that objectively tells them \nonly one person Liked their article.)\n• Criticism is more direct. Aspiring writers and \nindustry leaders will avoid partaking in the \nsocial world online because they don’t know \nhow they’d handle a negative comment or \nsomeone disagreeing with what they wrote.\n• “Anyone can write on social platforms.” This \nis a criticism I’ve heard from high-status \npeople who feel they are above sharing their \ninsight on the same platform as a “nobody.” \nThese are the types of people who chase \nafter contributing to major publications, \nalmost exclusively because there is a barrier \nto entry and being allowed in makes them \nfeel they are “where they should be.”\nMy opinion is that all these cons are self-inflicted, and \nlargely rooted in fear or insecurity. \nSocial platforms are fueling the next several generations of \nwriters, thinkers, creatives, and industry leaders, period.\n\n--- Page 108 ---\n\n100\nChapter 4Here are the social platforms likely to \nremain relevant over the next five, and \npotentially the next ten years.\n• Quora:  I firmly believe Quora is the most \nundervalued social platform on the inter -\nnet. With more than 300 million users and \nbillions of page views every month, this is \none of the lowest barrier to entry and high -\nest reward websites for writers. Quora is \ngreat for How To writers, Life Advice writ -\ners, and non-fiction writers. I have written \nextensively about how to use this platform \nby authoring The Ultimate Guide To Quora \non my website.\n• Medium: The second generation of Blogger, \nthe popular blogging website from the 2000s, \nMedium has become the best place to author \nopinion articles on the internet and build an \naudience for yourself as a columnist. You can \ngather data about who is reading your arti -\ncles, what their interests are, etc. And you \ncan tap into their ecosystem of 30M+ users. \nMedium caters to both fiction and non-fic -\ntion writers, however it caters dramatically \nmore to non-fiction, opinion, and How To \nwriters. \n• LinkedIn:  Most people don’t think of \nLinkedIn as a publishing platform, but it is. \nEspecially if you’re looking to write business, \nproductivity, technology, or news-related \n\n--- Page 109 ---\n\n101\nChapter 4material, LinkedIn can be a powerful chan -\nnel for extending your reach into these \nverticals and audiences. Again, why this \nplatform is valuable at this point in time is \nbecause it allows writers to build an audi -\nence, gather data, and tap into the hundreds \nof millions of users already on the platform.\n• Wattpad: For both fiction and non-fiction \nwriters (although more so for fiction writers), \nWattpad has become an incredibly power -\nful publishing platform. Here, anyone can \nbegin publishing pages of their stories and \nbooks in real time. Readers can follow you \nand your stories, comment on them for other \nreaders to see, and share your stories with \ntheir own friends. Wattpad has also created \nsome undeniable success stories in the indie \npublishing world, like Anna Todd—a young \nwriter who accumulated more than 1.5 bil -\nlion (with a B) reads on Wattpad, leading to \na publishing deal with Simon & Schuster. Her \nnovel, After, went on to reach #1 on the New \nYork Times  best-seller list, was translated \ninto 30+ languages, and was ultimately sold \nto Paramount Pictures for a movie adaption.\n• Twitter: Years ago, I discovered a Twit -\nter user by the name of @VeryShortStory. \nEvery single tweet was an entire story arc \nin less than 140 characters. Sure enough, \n@VeryShortStory accumulated more than \n100,000 followers, and eventually published \na book titled Very Short Stories .  \n\n--- Page 110 ---\n\n102\nChapter 4Thousands upon thousands of Twitter users \nhave followed this same recipe: experiment \nwith different niches, discover a voice that \nattracts an audience, and then eventually \nleverage that audience to launch a product \nand/or become an author.\n• Amazon: Technically, Amazon checks off all \nour boxes (userbase, data, and ability to build \nan audience), it just may take you longer and \ncost you a bit more time and money in order \nto discover what’s working and what’s not. \nMy personal belief is that it’s easier, more \nefficient, and more effective over the long \nterm if you start writing shorter form con -\ntent on social platforms (like the ones listed \nabove) and then publish proven material on \nAmazon. However, there are enough success \nstories of independent writers finding suc -\ncess exclusively on Amazon that it’s worth \nacknowledging the viability of this path from \na self-published author’s perspective.\nHere’s why I wouldn’t get too married to any one of \nthese platforms.\nEvery single website on the internet, social media plat -\nforms included, has a limited lifespan.\nSome websites, publications, and social media platforms \nlast a few years. Some last a decade. A rare few last beyond \nthat—and for those still standing, either the opportunity \nto capitalize has passed or you were one of the select few \nusers who rose to the top and you’re still reaping your \nrewards. YouTube, although not a writing platform, is \n\n--- Page 111 ---\n\n103\nChapter 4a terrific example. Trying to become a popular YouTuber \ntoday is much more difficult than it was 10 years ago. \nWe’re seeing the same thing happen in 2020 with podcasts \non Apple and Spotify. It’s much harder to start a popular \npodcast today than it was five years ago. Is it impossible? \nCertainly not. It’s just worth acknowledging where in the \nlife cycle each platform is when you begin.\nThe life cycle tends to look something like this:\nPhase 1: New website or platform is \ninvented—early audiences flock.\nThis is going to be a crash course in entrepreneurship and \nearly-stage investing.\nThe overwhelming pro to “starting early” on an emerging \nplatform is that as the platform grows, so do you. In fact, \nmany early-stage websites and social platforms will go \nabove and beyond to empower their early users and con -\ntent creators, because without you the site ceases to hold \nvalue. People don’t spend time on platforms that don’t have \ncontent they want to consume.\nThe con, however, is that you are banking on the platform’s \nsuccess in order to remain relevant. The earlier a platform is \nin its life cycle, the riskier an investment it is (for investors, \nbut also for content creators). You could invest a significant \namount of time, energy, and resources in bringing your \naudience from one platform over to this new platform, only \nfor the new platform to suddenly fail, go out of business, or \nget shut down. This is the argument 99% of people make \nfor why you shouldn’t start writing on a social platform, and \nwhy you should start a blog instead.\n\n--- Page 112 ---\n\n104\nChapter 4I want to clarify here I’m not advocating for going all-in \non emerging, high-risk social platforms. I’m advocating for \ntargeting slightly more established (or very established) \nsocial platforms, where a lot of things would need to go \nwrong for the company and website to fail.\nPhase 2: Website or platform starts \ngaining traction—early users become \n“influencers.”\nThe turning point for most emerging platforms is the point \nat which early users start becoming “internet celebrities” \nthat represent the platform.\nThis has happened on every single social platform in \nhistory. YouTube gave rise to “YouTubers.” Instagram \npower-users became “Instagram influencers.” Whenever a \nplatform starts growing exponentially and popular content \ncreators begin to separate themselves from the pack, the \n“game” is unveiled to the general public. Suddenly, anyone \nnew to the platform realizes there is a hierarchy, a ladder \nthey can climb—and if they are willing to “play the game,” \nthey can build an audience for themselves too.\nBy the time this happens, the website or social platform is \nlikely to be heavily funded. In Phase 1, a newer platform \nmight have raised anywhere from a few hundred thousand \ndollars to a few million dollars in order to gain initial trac -\ntion. By Phase 2, funding is likely closer to $30-50 million. \nFor example, Instagram raised $50 million at a $500 mil -\nlion valuation in its Series B. Quora raised the exact same \namount at a $400 million valuation.\nAt this point, the likelihood of a platform “failing” becomes \n\n--- Page 113 ---\n\n105\nChapter 4dramatically lower. Venture capitalists and seasoned \ninvestors don’t just watch a company valued at $500 mil -\nlion vanish into thin air, no matter how many worst-case \nscenario events happen. This means, even if you invested \na year or two into building your profile and content library \non a platform in phase 2, you would still have plenty of \ntime to move your audience and content elsewhere before \nthe platform went under.\nAgain, the likelihood of this happening is extremely small. \nBut since so many people choose blogging over writing \non social platforms for this exact reason, it’s important to \nunderstand the flaws in this thinking.\nPhase 3: Website or platform is estab -\nlished and begins a decade-long journey \nto profitability.\nThis was the phase Quora was in when I started writing on \nthe platform in 2014.\nFor context, Quora had raised its $50 million Series B \ntwo years prior, in 2012. Raising $50 million meant the \nplatform was signing itself up for a decade-long journey \nto slowly convert its free platform and users into an adver -\ntising revenue generating machine. By the time I joined \nthe platform, a small number of power-users had already \nbeen crowned as Top Writers, and the hierarchy had been \nestablished. It was also clear Quora wanted to continue \nrewarding these Top Writers, since they were responsi -\nble for engaging the platform’s community and writing \nhigh-quality content for the site.\nIn hindsight, I joined Quora at the perfect time.\n\n--- Page 114 ---\n\n106\nChapter 4I was early enough in the sense that the hierarchy had only \nrecently been established, but late enough to have confi -\ndence that time invested on this platform wouldn’t be for \nnothing. Quora was clearly growing fast, and the platform \nwould be alive for at least another five years—maybe even \nmore than a decade. Seeing both of these qualities is what \nmade me feel comfortable beginning to build myself there, \nand make Quora my primary writing platform.\nWhenever I look for new platforms to leverage as a writer, \nthis is the “window” I look for. Because this “window” pro -\nvides maximum upside for content creators.\nThe reason is because as soon as a platform reaches this \nstage, it needs to achieve certain exposure and engage -\nment metrics in order to warrant turning on its advertising \nmachine. In 2014, when I started writing on Quora, ads \non the site didn’t exist yet—and over the next few years, \nthey only existed in beta form to a very small number of \ntest clients.\nWhat these social platforms then do is begin prioritizing \ntheir high-volume and high-engagement content creators, \ngiving them more and more exposure in user feeds—\nbecause they want to ensure engagement metrics remain \nhigh. In addition, because there isn’t any advertising on \nthe site or in-feed yet, there is dramatically less friction \nbetween you and the people who follow you. Back then, \nif I wrote something on Quora, there was a good chance \nnearly every single person who followed me saw it.\nAs the years went on, this was no longer the case.\n\n--- Page 115 ---\n\n107\nChapter 4Phase 4: Advertising model is launched \nand user reach starts falling.\nAs soon as advertising begins on a platform, you can \nexpect your reach to fall. \nMost people don’t know why this happens, so let me \nexplain.\nWhen a platform monetizes with ads, what happens is they \nhave to start picking and choosing which content to show \nusers in their feeds. Without ads, you might have seen 20 \npotential pieces of content in the three minutes you spent \nscrolling. But with ads, you might only see 15 pieces of \ncontent, with 5 ads sprinkled in. Well, where did the other \n5 pieces of content go? They’re still somewhere on the site, \nthey’re just not being prioritized—which means those con -\ntent creators are getting less views.\nThis is what’s known as “throttling.” The platform begins \nto withhold your reach as a content creator, forcing you to \nspend money in order to receive the same amount of expo -\nsure you used to receive organically. Facebook invented \nthis model, and it’s the reason why less than 3% of all your \nFacebook fans see any of the content you post on the plat -\nform—unless you spend money to “Boost” it.\nThe exposure I received on my Quora answers in 2015 was \nsignificantly higher than the exposure I received in 2018, \n2019, and so on. That’s because I was in “the window” \nwhere the platform was growing like crazy, but hadn’t \nyet started throttling user reach and adding ads into the \nmix. By 2018, that window had passed, and even though \nI was still averaging hundreds of thousands of views on my \n\n--- Page 116 ---\n\n108\nChapter 4content, it was a fraction of what I had been averaging just \ntwo years prior.\nNow, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and your reaction \nshouldn’t be, “That’s so unfair!”\nThe reality is, these social platforms need to find a way to \nmake money, and this is one of the only models (thus far) \nwith any sort of proven success. Otherwise, all our favorite \nsocial platforms would require a monthly subscription to \nbe ad-free (like Netflix).\nSecond, once a platform incorporates advertising revenue \n(or moves to a subscription model, like Medium has), this \nusually means mechanisms are being launched to pay and \nreward content creators as well. For example, YouTube \nlaunching ads meant YouTubers could monetize their \nchannels. Instagram launching ads meant you could build \nyour audience on Instagram, boost certain posts, and drive \ntraffic to a site where you were selling a product. Medium \nmoving to a subscription and paywall model meant writers \ncould earn money based on how many views their pieces \nbehind Medium’s paywall generated.\nThe name of the game is understanding where a platform \nis in its lifecycle, so that you can take maximum advantage \nof its current state.\n\n--- Page 117 ---\n\n109\nChapter 4Phase 5: Business model is established, \nreach is throttled, and it’s time to find \na new platform.\nOnce a social platform has fully integrated advertising into \nits model, organic reach will only continue to decline.\nIf you started investing in a platform early, or joined at \na time where you were able to climb the ranks and become \none of its power users, then you will forever have an advan -\ntage over other, newer users. For example, I contribute new \ncontent to Quora far less now than I did in 2015. However, \nmy audience is still intact, meaning my organic exposure is \ngoing to be dramatically higher than someone who is just \nstarting on the platform today. That said, every few years \na new “class” of power-users emerges across all social plat -\nforms. Either previous power-users reached their goals and \nplateaued, got burned out and quit, or decided to move on \nto a new platform. So while you will maintain an advantage, \nyou won’t stay “king of the hill” forever and ever.\nAt this point, you have two options.\nAs a writer, you can either continue investing all of your \ntime into your original platform, and if the platform is \nproviding you with enough upside (reach is still great, \naudience is still growing, and content is still generating \na profit—either directly via products or indirectly via \nexposure), then you should stay put. Or, you can diversify, \nand start moving your audience somewhere else. Ideally, \nyou would want to move them to the next platform you see \nentering its own Phase 2 or Phase 3, providing you with \na new window of opportunity for rampant growth.\n\n--- Page 118 ---\n\n110\nChapter 4For example:\n• If you remember all those success stories of \nAmazon self-published authors selling hun -\ndreds of thousands of copies of eBooks in \nthe late 2000s, that’s because Amazon was \nin its “window” of opportunity for self-pub -\nlished authors. It’s still possible today, it’s \njust harder, more expensive, with far more \ncompetition.\n• If you remember how brands were willing \nto pay obscene amounts of money for cam -\npaigns with Instagram influencers between \n2012 and 2016, that’s because Instagram was \nin its “window” of opportunity for influenc -\ners. By 2017, supply had increased, demand \nhad decreased, and “Influencer Marketing” \n(although still tremendously popular) had \nlost its allure. You can still make money as \na social media influencer today, there’s just \nmore competition.\n• If you remember when Musical.ly started \nturning teenagers into lip-sync superstars in \n2016, that’s because the platform had entered \nits “window” of opportunity for a new form of \ncontent creators. A year later, it was acquired \nby TikTok, and creators who had invested \nduring that “window” of growth suddenly \nsaw an insane increase in exposure over the \nfollowing three years. By 2019, TikTok had \nstarted beta testing in-feed ads, signaling the \nplatform had officially entered Phase 4.\n\n--- Page 119 ---\n\n111\nChapter 4As you can see, this lifecycle occurs on all types  of social \nplatforms.\nThis is what I mean when I say, whichever platform is \n“where you should be writing” today, won’t necessarily \nbe “where you should be writing” tomorrow. For example, \nMedium launched in 2012, and I didn’t start writing there \nuntil 2017. Why? Because the platform hadn’t matured \nenough yet. \nIn Phase 1 and 2, Medium was extremely small, niche, and \ninvite-only—primarily focusing on attracting high-level \njournalism talent. Around 2014 was when the site started \nto open up and attract more “everyday” writers. And by \n2015, the company had raised $57 million in Series B, fol -\nlowed by another $50 million in Series C a year after. The \n“window” of opportunity had begun, and as a writer, I felt \nconfident that time invested in the platform wouldn’t go \nto waste.\nI was right.\nBetween 2017 and today, I have accumulated more than \n55,000 followers on the platform, and generated more \nthan 20,000,000 views on my writing on Medium alone. \nThe important nuance here is that I have written very \nlittle *new* material on Medium—55,000 followers and 20 \nmillion views have come as a result of simply republishing \nall my old Quora content, as well as my 409 Inc Magazine  \ncolumns (crediting the publication at the bottom of each \npost, of course) on a daily basis.\nIn addition, when Medium launched its paid program in \n2018, incentivizing writers to publish their writing behind \nthe platform’s paywall, I started republishing all my old \n\n--- Page 120 ---\n\n112\nChapter 4content behind their paywall. “Maybe this will be like \nearning royalties on work I’ve already written,” I thought. \nNobody said I could or couldn’t do this—I just decided \nto test the rules of the game on my own. To date, I’ve \ngenerated close to $100,000 from Medium alone (averag -\ning $2,500 to $5,000 per month), all from republishing \nold content.\nWill this last forever?\nMaybe. Maybe not.\nOf all writing platforms today, Medium is one of the most \nuncertain. The company has raised $137 million, been \naround for almost a decade, and still isn’t profitable. \nThat said, the CEO is Ev Williams, who was the former \nco-founder and CEO of Twitter. So again, Medium isn’t \ngoing to just vanish into thin air. However, it’s worth \nremaining conscious of where platforms like Medium are \nin their lifecycles, so that you can make conscious deci -\nsions about where you want to invest your time, energy, \nand resources.\nWhen it comes to writing online, platforms will always \nchange, but the rules will stay (pretty much) the \nsame.\nFor example, the next writing platform I am paying close \nattention to these days is Substack.\nSubstack is aiming to be the “social” writing platform \nfor paid newsletters. The reason I say “social” is because, \nunlike true social platforms where the purpose is to \nbrowse and scroll, Substack actually operates much closer \nto a tool for writers rather than a social environment  \n\n--- Page 121 ---\n\n113\nChapter 4(in the sense that there isn’t an algorithmic feed where you \ncan consume new content, follow writers, etc.). However, \nthe fact that they allow users to loosely browse newsletter \ncreators tells me the social component of their site will \ndevelop over time.\nSubstack is still in Phase 1.\nIn 2019, the platform raised $15.3 million from one of the \nmost well-known venture capital firms in Silicon Valley—\nAndreesen Horowitz (a16z). This means some very smart \npeople are betting on the growth of the category of “paid \nnewsletters” for writers and media creators. If this category \ncontinues to grow, and Substack is the creator of this cate -\ngory, then you better believe the platform is going to grow \nexponentially over the next five plus years.\nFor this reason, I’ve already moved my own newsletter over \nto Substack.\n\n--- Page 122 ---\n\n114Chapter  5\nHow Writing On Social \nPlatforms Works (And How \nTo Not Give Up)\nDeciding to start writing online is one thing.\nNot giving up is entirely another.\nThe unfortunate reality is that most of us suffer from \n“instant gratification syndrome.” As soon as we start some -\nthing new, we want to know we’re amazing at it, that the \nworld loves us, and all we could have ever desired is about \nto come barreling forth. The number of people who have \nsaid to me, “I just wrote my first article online, but I only \ngot 37 views so I don’t know if it’s really working,” would \nshock you.\nThe truth is, nobody , not even the most talented writers on \nearth, show up to a brand-new platform, write one single \narticle, and experience overnight success. There is no such \nthing as, “I wrote my first piece and received 10 million \nviews.” If that’s your expectation, get it out of your head \nnow.\nSecond, and I’m going to be brutally honest with you here, \nunless you really love the craft and process of writing, the \npath to becoming an independent, successful, widely read \nwriter on the internet is going to frustrate the absolute shit \nout of you. Writing online requires an unrelenting commit -\n\n--- Page 123 ---\n\n115\nChapter 5ment to consistency. Writing online means tolerating the \nfact that pieces you spend hours slaving over are going to \ngo unnoticed, while pieces you write in twenty minutes \nare going to land on the front page of Reddit and go viral \n(which is what happened to me). On top of that, writing \nonline (and the onslaught of feedback you will receive, \nboth positive and negative) is not for the faint of heart. \nOne of the very first comments I received on one of my ear -\nliest blogs as a teenager was, “This wasn’t worth reading, \nand you’re a terrible writer. I hope you get hit by a bus on \nyour way to school.” How 17-year-old me internalized that \nas positive motivation, I’ll never know.\nHOWEVER…\nMastering the art of online writing is also incredibly \nrewarding.\nBy learning how to use your voice, how to create your own \ncategory, and how to market yourself, your words, your \nbooks, and yourself as a brand, you will have far more \nleverage than 99% of writers out there.\nAnd leverage means freedom.\nIf your goal is to be a successful writer, then social \nplatforms are for publishing first, and consuming \nsecond.\nI have a rule I live by, and it goes like this:\n“The number of hours I spend consuming should never equal \nor exceed the number of hours I spend creating.”\nOne of the biggest mistakes aspiring writers make is they \nspend hours and hours scrolling through social platforms \n\n--- Page 124 ---\n\n116\nChapter 5and websites, looking at other writers and asking them -\nselves who they’re supposed to “be.” This habit eventually \nevolves into an obsession with trying to find “the answer” \nby consuming other writers—instead of investing that time \ninto exploring themselves.\nThe purpose of writing on social platforms and “Practicing \nin Public” is not to read. I don’t care what famous author \nor literature teacher said that in order to become a great \nwriter, you have to read. Yes, that’s true. But there should \nbe an asterisk that clarifies that stupid phrase and says, \n*BUT, the number of hours you spend consuming should never \nequal or exceed the number of hours you spend creating . You \ndon’t become a writer by reading other writers. \nYou become a writer by writing—a lot.\nWhen you start writing on a social platform, your goal is \nto “beat the game.” In order to beat the game, you need to \nactually play the game, get feedback from the game, and \ninternalize that feedback to change your strategies over \ntime and make your way up the ladder—in whatever form \nthat means to you. The more you write, the more data you \nwill accumulate, the better your skills will get, the faster \nyou will learn. Conversely, the less you write, the less data \nyou will accumulate, the longer it will take for your skills \nto improve, the slower you will learn.\nIn order to set expectations properly, let’s walk through \nthe different stages of growth you will experience when \nwriting on a social platform.\nStage 1: Just Start Writing\nIt doesn’t matter who you are—a recent college graduate \n\n--- Page 125 ---\n\n117\nChapter 5with big dreams of becoming the next James Patterson, or \nthe retired CEO of a publicly traded company—the first \nthing you write and publish on the internet is going to give \nyou anxiety.\nThere’s a lot of pressure that comes with writing online. \n“What will people think? Am I doing it right? What if \nsomeone disagrees with me? Will I even like what I wrote \na few months from now?” After more than a decade of con -\nfronting these same questions in myself, as well as talking \nhundreds and hundreds of other writers (and clients) off \nthis very same ledge, what I’ve ultimately concluded as \nbeing the underlying fear, the “root of the root,” is fear of \nregret.\nWe are afraid of sharing who we are today—because we \nbelieve who we’ll be tomorrow will be “better.”\nThis is a vicious cycle.\nPart of getting started writing online means acknowledg -\ning that whatever it is you publish today will not be the \nsingle greatest thing you ever write. In fact, if it was, I’d \nmake the argument you have an even worse problem on \nyour hands. Instead of getting better over time, you’re \ngoing to get worse.\nOn April 11, 2014, I wrote my very first answer on Quora. \nHere it is, in all its glory:\nIs Elite Daily a legitimate site? Why?\nI was a contributing writer for Elite Daily a while back-\n--which probably isn’t the best thing to admit with my \nfollowing opinion:\n\n--- Page 126 ---\n\n118\nChapter 5The site does a great job at making you think what you’re \nreading is well-informed and worthwhile, but the truth \nis, a lot of the writers are kids no older than you (if you’re \nin the 20-26 demographic) and are merely sharing their \nopinions. Nothing wrong with that. I was one of them, and if \nthey’re good enough writers, the content can be entertaining \nand even somewhat knowledgable. Seeing as the news these \ndays is hardly worth the title “professional” anyway, Elite \nDaily can be a great resource for someone looking for quick \nnews or a nice list of 10 reasons why they shouldn’t be in a \ncommitted relationship at 22 years old. But should you read \nElite Daily hoping to have the mental whip of someone who \nreads Harvard Business Review or Chicago Booth’s Capital \nIdeas? No. No you should not. That’d be like reading Buzz -\nfeed and wondering why your ACT score isn’t improving.\nElite Daily on Twitter is nice because they keep you informed \nabout pop culture. Beyond that, it is barely a college-level \nnewspaper.\nEnd scene.\nIf it’s not blindingly obvious, my writing style has evolved \nsignificantly since that first Quora answer—and that \nanswer was a 10x improvement compared to my gaming \nblogs as a teenager. I don’t write with those same rhythms \nanymore. I don’t use rapid-fire metaphors, or have that \nsame underlying sarcastic tone. Yet, that’s where I was in \nmy life when I wrote that. I was 24 years old. I was trying \nto “prove” I knew how to write. And on that day, in that \none Quora answer, I captured “me” in that moment of time.\nLooking back at it now, I don’t feel regret.\n\n--- Page 127 ---\n\n119\nChapter 5What I feel is astonishment at how much I’ve improved—\nand thankfulness I had the guts to begin the journey of \npracticing my craft.\nEvery time I’ve started writing on a new platform online, \nI’ve found the beginning pattern to look something like \nthis:\nPost #1:  “Hello! Thank you for having me. It’s truly an \nhonor for me to be here, internet.”\nPost #2:  “Alright look, here’s the real deal. I’m going to \ngive it to you straight.”\nPost #3:  “What is life, what am I doing here, and does any \nof this even matter?”\nRight around Post #4 is where the first real checkpoint \nkicks in. The novelty of starting something new wears off, \ndata begins revealing the truth of the situation—“I’m not \nan overnight success story, what?”—and subconsciously \nthere is a realization that any and all success will be the \nproduct of hard work.\nThis is where the vast majority of people give up.\nStage 2: Write Consistently For 6 Months \nAnd Then  Make A Decision\nThe writers who become successful aren’t necessarily the \nmost talented writers.\nThe writers who become successful are the most consistent  \nwriters.\n\n--- Page 128 ---\n\n120\nChapter 5It’s impossible to know whether or not you have some -\nthing meaningful to say, or if a platform is worth writing \non, unless you give yourself six months to find out. When \nmy co-founder and I started Digital Press, ghostwriting on \nbehalf of busy founders and executives, we required them \nto sign six-month contracts for our service—not because \nwe wanted to guarantee longer term revenue (although, \nthat too), but because it would have been impossible to \njudge the value we were providing in thirty or sixty days. \nTruthfully, even six months is a hyper-condensed time -\nframe—but it’s usually enough time to get some sense as to \nwhat’s working and what isn’t.\nIn the first six months of writing anywhere social on the \ninternet, you have three primary goals:\nGoal #1: See whether or not you can be consistent.\nNothing else matters unless you are writing on a regular \nbasis.\nGrowth hacks, social media strategies, “viral tactics,” none \nof it can be applied to your writing unless you’re actively \nwriting in the first place.\nIf you are publishing once every two months, or once every \nsix months, then you should not have any expectations \nfor the performance of your writing. Don’t be surprised if \nnobody follows you. Don’t be upset if you don’t “rise up the \nranks” on any of the platforms. Realize you are treating \nwriting as a hobby, which means you are not actively play -\ning (and competing within) “the game.”\nThe minimum amount you should be writing and pub -\nlishing new material online is once per month. That is the \n\n--- Page 129 ---\n\n121\nChapter 5absolute minimum. The people who can get away with \nthis cadence are executives, speakers, authors, investors, \nand working professionals who have already made strides \nbuilding themselves on the internet. These are people \nwho are further along in their careers, and have built an \nengaged network on LinkedIn or a buzzy following on \nTwitter. It’s very rare that someone with absolutely zero \ndigital footprint (regardless of how successful or well-\nknown you are in the real world) starts writing online and \nimmediately commands attention.\nMy true “recommended minimum” however is to publish \nsomething once every other week.\nIn order to be taken seriously on the internet as  \nan authority in your category and a leader in your \nindustry, niche, or genre, you need to be writing  \nand publishing new material 2x per month.\nGoing back to what we talked about earlier in this book, \nthe reason people choose to “follow” writers online in the \nfirst place is because they are looking for a credible source \nof information within a particular category. \nSeeing that someone publishes new information once per \nmonth, or once every few months, doesn’t typically satisfy \nour wants as audience members. But if you come across \nsomeone publishing new material a few times a month, or \nbetter yet, every week, you’ll be much more likely to follow \nthem and have a reason to pay attention. And if you really  \nwant to beat the game of capturing and keeping attention, \nif you truly want the most guaranteed path to success, then \nyou need to be writing and publishing something new sev -\neral times per week—or ideally, every single day.\n\n--- Page 130 ---\n\n122\nChapter 5There are a few reasons why.\nFirst,  think of a social media algorithm as a roulette wheel. \nThe more times you spin the wheel, the more chances you \nhave of winning. Every time you create a new piece of con -\ntent, you are pushing that content into the social platform’s \nalgorithm and “spinning the wheel.” If you are only writing \nand publishing once per month, you are only spinning the \nwheel once every thirty days. But if you’re writing and pub -\nlishing every single day, you’re spinning the wheel thirty \ntimes in thirty days. Compound this over the course of six \nmonths, and the former is only getting to play the game \nsix times, while the latter is getting to play the game 180 \ntimes. Who do you think is going to win more often?\nSecond,  readers are fickle. So are viewers, listeners, and \nconsumers of any type of content. We are developing more \nand more into a world of instant gratification. If my favor -\nite content creator stops playing the game, I’m not going \nto sit around and wait for them to come back. I’m going \nto find someone new to pay attention to. For this reason \nalone, you have to understand that in order to be “seen” \nas a credible, consistent source of information, you need \nto prove to audience members you’re going to be there for \nthem and with them, day in and day out.\nThird,  you have no idea which one of your creations is \ngoing to be “the one” that takes off. Just a few months \nbefore starting this book, I was trying to decide which arti -\ncle of mine to republish on Medium that day. I took a look \nthrough my library and found this short post about rela -\ntionships I had written fairly quickly almost a year prior. \n“Eh, nobody really liked this article on Quora, I doubt it’ll \ndo very well on Medium,” I thought. Still, I didn’t know \n\n--- Page 131 ---\n\n123\nChapter 5what else to publish, so I threw it on Medium anyway. \nWithin an hour, it started going viral, and by the end of \nthe day it had become one of my most-popular Medium \narticles of all time, racking up more than 200,000 views \nand 20,000 Claps. This exact situation has happened to \nme more times than I can count—and what I’ve learned is, \nI don’t know which of my pieces are going to perform the \nbest, and you don’t either. All that matters is whether or \nnot we keep spinning the wheel and playing the game.\nGoal #2: Start gathering data about what your most \npopular categories are.\nIn your first six months of writing online, you should be \nless concerned with “establishing” yourself and more \nfocused on “discovering” yourself.\nThe way we would engineer this process for our clients at \nDigital Press is we would come up with three categories \n(“Content Buckets”) that represented who they were and \nwhat they wanted to write about. One category might be \ntheir industry (Biotech), the second might be related to \ntheir position within their company (Marketing), and the \nthird might be a personal interest (Mountain Biking & \nSelf-Discipline).\nWe would then begin writing and publishing content in all \nthree of these different categories, alternating back and \nforth until we started to see patterns emerge. We were \nrunning an experiment. And what we usually found was, \nthe topics they thought  people would want to hear about \nfrom them weren’t actually the topics data told us were \nmost engaging. In this example, these were the buckets of \na client of ours who is the CEO of a publicly traded bio -\ntech company. Turns out, his most popular articles weren’t \n\n--- Page 132 ---\n\n124\nChapter 5academic takes on the biotech industry. His most popular \narticles were stories about the mountain biking trips he \nwould take with his friends, and the lessons he learned \nabout self-discipline in the process.\nOnce you start gathering data about what’s working and \nwhat isn’t, you now have a decision to make.\nIf you start writing about marketing strategies, but data \ntells you it’s your stories about being an angel investor \npeople love reading most, you should pay attention to that. \nIf you start writing sci-fi, but you discover it’s actually your \nhistorical fiction people are flocking to, data is trying to \ntell you something. If you start writing poetry, but you find \nyour morning meditations are what get dozens of people \nto comment and engage with your writing, what are you \ngoing to do? Keep writing poetry?\nOnce data enters the equation, this is where the “Who Do \nI Want To Be?” conversation gets interesting. Do you want \nto keep writing what you had originally wanted to write \nabout? Or do you want to write what people clearly want \nmore of?\nMy answer is: you should always do both.\nData doesn’t lie. But data is also a reflection of the \nexternal crowd, and not necessarily your internal \ncompass.\nIf all you want is to climb the ladder as fast as possible and \ncollect as many external achievements as you can (badges, \nawards, money, etc.), then follow the data and do nothing \nelse. If what the world wants from you is life lessons, then \ngive them life lessons. Let data tell you your next move, \ngive people exactly what they want, and win the game.\n\n--- Page 133 ---\n\n125\nChapter 5On the flipside, if you don’t really care what the outcome is \n(people say this is what they want but then get frustrated \nwhen nobody reads their writing), then ignore the data. \nLive your life, write your poetry, and satisfy your soul.\nHowever, I believe (and have discovered for myself) there \nis a third option, and that’s to optimize the former so you \ncan introduce people to the latter.  For example, I recently \nwrote a book of poetry called Slow Down, Wake Up, and \nstarted sharing more of my poems on social platforms like \nQuora, Medium, and Twitter. I like writing poetry. I’ve \nbeen writing poetry for more than a decade. Instead of \nignoring this “content bucket” in my library completely, \nI’ve leveraged my proven  writing to bring attention to my \npassion  writing. I let data tell me what people want to hear \nfrom me most, and leverage that data to “win the game,” \nwhile still keeping my own personal projects as a priority.\nThis book you’re reading is a perfect example.\nA lot of people follow me on Quora, Medium, Twitter, and \nInstagram because of the writing advice I share. Data tells \nme this is one of my high performing “content buckets.” \nBut within this book, I just told you about a poetry book \nI wrote called Slow Down, Wake Up . If you enjoy me as \na writer, maybe you’ll check it out.\nI’m not pretending my poetry doesn’t exist.\nI’m giving you both—while also understanding which topic \narea is the priority for most of my readers.\nGoal #3: Pay close attention to writers at the top of \nthe hierarchy of the social platform—and constantly \nmeasure yourself against their performance.\n\n--- Page 134 ---\n\n126\nChapter 5People make “the game” of social media so much more \ncomplicated than it really is.\nIf you want to surpass even the most popular, highest-per -\nforming writers within an existing category , all you have to \ndo is everything they’re doing, more consistently.\n• If they publish new material 7 days per week, you \nneed to publish new material 7 days per week.\n• If they write 3,000+ word stories, you \nshould write 3,000+ word stories.\n• If they interview industry titans and summa -\nrize their takeaways, you should interview \nindustry titans and summarize their take -\naways.\n• If they encourage readers to Tweet them \nwith questions and ideas, you should encour -\nage readers to Tweet you with questions and \nideas. And if they respond to every single \nTweet that comes their way, you should \nrespond to every single Tweet that comes \nyour way.\n• Etc.\nYour job is to study the competition and understand exactly \nwhy they are succeeding in the first place.\nIf they title their articles in all caps, why are they doing \nthat? Was there a point in time when they weren’t doing \nthat? What happened to their engagement once they \nstarted doing that? Have their Likes, Comments, Views, etc., \nincreased since then?\n\n--- Page 135 ---\n\n127\nChapter 5If they make each sentence of their post its own paragraph, \nwhy are they doing that? What’s the effect it has on you, the \nreader? Was there a point in time when they weren’t doing \nthat? What happened to their engagement once they started \ndoing that?\nIf they post a high-quality photo at the top of every article, \nwhy are they doing that? What do you think they’re trying \nto achieve? Was there a point in time when they weren’t \ndoing that? What happened to their engagement once they \nstarted doing that?\nQuestion everything. Nothing a creator does repeatedly is \naccidental.\nThe creator might not be fully conscious of how or why \nthey decided to start using shorter paragraphs, or why they \nintuitively stopped using as many sub-heads, but if it’s a \npattern that means something about it is working. It’s your \njob to spot those patterns, mimic them, and then slowly \nshape them into your own style.\nFor example, if you wanted to “beat me” at the game \nof online writing, and acquire all the achievements \nI’ve acquired, all you would need to do is:\n• Publish something new every single day \n(because I publish something new every \nsingle day).\n• Write fast-paced articles that use short para -\ngraphs, declarative language, and subheads \nfor every main point.\n• Combine actionable advice for the reader \nwith personal stories from your own life that \n\n--- Page 136 ---\n\n128\nChapter 5illustrate how you gained the insight you’re \nsharing in the first place.\n• Collaborate with professional photographers, \nbuild your personal brand, and attach pic -\ntures of yourself with the articles you write.\n• Publish more than 3,000 articles online over \nthe next five years.\n• Contribute dozens of articles to Inc Magazine, \nForbes, Harvard Business Review, Fortune, \nBusiness Insider , The Chicago Tribune, The \nHuffington Post, TIME , and more, to build \nyour Perceived Credibility.\n• Land a few speaking gigs, and capture \npictures of you speaking to illustrate more \nPerceived Credibility.\n• Speak on 100+ different podcasts, illustrat -\ning even more Perceived Credibility.\n• Etc.\nWhat a lot of people don’t realize is that each one of these \n“achievements” is nothing more than a step along the jour -\nney. Just one single step. When I first started playing “the \ngame,” these were the steps I realized other writers (the \nwriters I wanted to be like and surpass) had taken them -\nselves. My first week on Quora, I quickly saw that all the top \nwriters were publishing something new every day—which \nmeant, if I wanted to be like them, I needed to publish \nsomething new every day too. And all of them wrote in this \nfast-paced style that never forced the reader to slog through \na long, boring paragraph—which meant, if I wanted to \n\n--- Page 137 ---\n\n129\nChapter 5engage with audience members the same way, I needed to \nwrite in that fast-paced style too. And all of them had found \na way to get some of their articles republished in major \npublications like TIME, Forbes, Business Insider , etc.—which \nmeant I needed to find a way to get some of my articles \nrepublished in those major publications too.\nThese unspoken “rules of the game” exist on every single \nplatform.\nAll the most-popular Twitter writers share things in \ncommon. All the most-popular YouTubers share things \nin common. All the most-popular Medium writers share \nthings in common. All the most-popular Quora writers \nshare things in common.\nYour job is to find the common threads, make them part of \nyour own strategy, and then slowly over time create a style \nand category of your own.\nStage 3: Once You’ve Proven You Can Be \nConsistent, Pour Some Gasoline On Your \nFire And Go KABOOM!\nIf you can make it through Stage 1 and 2, chances are, \nyou’ll start to see a very clear path forward for yourself as \na writer.\nHowever, if you’re unable to be consistent for six months, if \nyou’re incapable (no matter how hard you try) to write on \na regular basis, I have some bad news for you:\nYou’re not a writer.\n\n--- Page 138 ---\n\n130\nChapter 5I’m intentionally being blunt here because if you strug -\ngle with self-doubt, then I really want this point to sink \nin. Being a writer is not a destination. There isn’t a point \non the road at which you are, officially , someone worth \nfollowing on the internet. Attention has to be earned, \nengagement has to be nurtured, and most of all, relevancy \nhas to be maintained. Which means, if you truly want writ -\ning to be part of your life or career, then “being a writer” \nisn’t actually your goal. Your goal is to write (ACTION)—\nand it’s through  writing  that you will BE “a writer.”\nSo, if you can’t be consistent for six months, either realize \nyou love the idea of being seen as a writer more than you \nlove sitting down and writing and move on to something \nelse, OR, try again.\nPinpoint your mistakes.\nBe honest about why you weren’t able to remain consistent.\nConfront some fears, get back on the horse, and start writ -\ning again TODAY.\nConsistent output is the secret  to every growth metric \non the internet: Views, Comments, Likes, Shares, etc.\nOnce you have a sound foundation as a consistent writer \non the internet, now you can begin adding in all the fun \ngrowth strategies that start to separate amateur writers \nfrom professional writers.\n\n--- Page 139 ---\n\n131\nChapter 5Here are some of my favorite, all of which remain true no \nmatter which platform(s) you choose:\nAudience Hacking\nAudience Hacking means collaborating with another writer \nwho has a similar audience to you—introducing your \naudience to them and their audience to you. The reason \nI encourage you to target writers with a similar sized \naudience though is because it’s unlikely you’re going to get \nsomeone with 10x more followers to want to power-level \nyou—but people who are around your level tend to see it \nas an even trade. This writer could be within your chosen \ncategory , however I would actually encourage you to find \nways to collaborate with writers outside of your category \nas well—so you can widen your net.\nCollaborations could include:\n• Co-authoring an article together\n• You interviewing them, and them interview -\ning you\n• You sharing one of their articles, them shar -\ning one of your articles\n• You both meeting up in real life, taking a pic -\nture or shooting a short video clip together, \nposting it and tagging each other\n• You giving them a testimonial, and them \ngiving you a testimonial\n• Basically you both creating or sharing con -\n\n--- Page 140 ---\n\n132\nChapter 5tent of any kind together, and sharing it with \nyour respective audiences\nFor example: the testimonial on the cover of this book is \nfrom Dr. Benjamin Hardy. Ben became the #1 most-read \nwriter on Medium right around the same time I became \nthe #1 most-read writer on Quora. We were connected \nthrough a mutual friend, and because we had both climbed \nup our respective ranks in very similar ways, we became \nfriends too. As I was getting ready to publish this book, I \nthought, “What writers around my level would be willing \nto collaborate?” I reached out to him, and he offered to \ngive me a testimonial for my book if I gave him a testimo -\nnial for his.\nAudience Hacking is extremely common in every industry. \nWhen a New York Times  best-selling book has a testimonial \non the cover from another NYT best-selling author, that’s \nAudience Hacking. When one podcaster interviews another \nwell-known podcaster, that’s Audience Hacking. When a \npopular fashion YouTuber makes a video with a popular \ncosmetics YouTuber, that’s Audience Hacking. When Justin \nBieber makes a song with Ariana Grande, that’s Audience \nHacking.\nIt’s an incredibly effective way to market yourself to new \naudiences while at the same time creating content that is \ndifferent and maybe even better than what you could oth -\nerwise create on your own.\n\n--- Page 141 ---\n\n133\nChapter 5Trend Jacking\nTrend Jacking is probably the easiest, most common \ngrowth hack on the internet.\nWhenever something big happens in the news, it becomes \na “trend” for a month, a week, a day, or sometimes even \na couple of hours. When a celebrity makes headlines, when \na public company makes a big mistake, when an everyday \nperson goes viral, these “trends” spark a crazy amount of \nengagement on social media—which you can use to your \nadvantage.\nTrend Jacking is where you hop on someone else’s train in \norder to bring some of that heightened attention back to \nyourself.\nThis was a very common tactic nearly every top contribut -\ning writer used at Inc Magazine . We would all set Google \nAlerts for companies and public figures that aligned with our \nrespective columns, and we’d wait for them to be mentioned \nin the news. For example, in 2017, Mark Zuckerberg said in \nan interview that he was changing Facebook’s mission. The \ncompany’s previous mission, “To give people the power to \nshare and make the world more open and connected,” was \nunder fire after playing a controversial role in the 2016 presi -\ndential election. In this particular interview, Zuckerberg said \nFacebook was planning to double down on Facebook Groups, \nand its mission had evolved to, “Giving people the power to \nbuild community and bring the world closer together.”\nKnowing Facebook was all over the news, and knowing Inc \nMagazine  wanted to jack the trend, I wrote a piece titled, \nMark Zuckerberg Just Changed Facebook’s Mission—Here It \nIs In 1 Sentence.\n\n--- Page 142 ---\n\n134\nChapter 5That article became one of my most popular articles ever, \naccumulating hundreds of thousands of views in a matter \nof days.\nEngagement Hacking\nThis growth tactic can be very tedious, but it works \nextremely well.\nEngagement Hacking is where you engage with the audi -\nences of other writers, introducing them to your own \nwriting.\nThe first step is to make a list of other writers within your \nchosen category . If you write about life lessons, go look for \nother popular writers who also write about life lessons. If \nyou write mystery stories, go find other writers who write \nmystery stories. Once you have a list of ten or fifteen writ -\ners (ideally with audiences similar and slightly larger than \nyour own), go to each of their profiles and start comment -\ning on recent content they’ve published—or, even better, \nrespond to someone else’s comment on their content. For \nexample, if one writer’s most recent post was on life les -\nsons you should learn before you turn 30 years old, and \nsomeone commented, “I would add a few more to this list,” \nrespond back to them and piggy-back on their list to add \na few more suggestions of your own.\nThe whole idea here is to get your name in front of the \nsame people who are actively looking for the type of \ncontent you write. When that audience member sees you \nresponded to their comment, they’re going to read it. \nWhen they read it, and if it’s something more thoughtful \nthan just, “Nice one!” they’re going to go to your profile. \n\n--- Page 143 ---\n\n135\nChapter 5And when they go to your profile and see that you actively  \nwrite about similar material as the writer they already love \nand follow, there’s a good chance they’ll start following \nyou too—especially if they feel like you’ve started building \na relationship with them.\nHashtag Stacking\nMost people don’t know how hashtags actually work.\nA hashtag is nothing more than a folder. It’s a way of organiz -\ning content that is “tagged” the same thing. When you place \na hashtag on a social media post, all you’re doing is saying, \n“This piece of content should be organized in this folder.”\nThe biggest mistake people make when using hashtags is \ntreating them as words and phrases within their actual \nmessage. For example, they might post on Facebook: “I just \nwrote this piece. I hope you enjoy it! #myfirstposteveromg \n#2020\nThe hashtag #2020 works, because that’s a hashtag a lot of \nother people use to organize their content. But the hashtag \n#myfirstposteveromg isn’t a folder people are using—and \nif it is, it’s not specific enough to warrant someone using \nit to search for the content they’re trying to find. Which \nmeans that hashtag doesn’t actually do anything for your \ndistribution efforts. \nIf you are writing or sharing links to your writing on plat -\nforms that use hashtags, the correct way to do hashtag \nstacking is to do a little research before you post—so you \ncan tag your content with popular, relevant folders. First, \ngo back to your list of popular writers within your chosen \ncategory. What hashtags are they using? Why are they using \n\n--- Page 144 ---\n\n136\nChapter 5them? For example, one writer might tag all of their posts \n#writingadvice, because if you’re searching for writing \nadvice on a social platform, this is a good folder to start \nscrolling through. By tagging your posts with that same \nhashtag, all you’re doing is telling the platform to organize \nthis specific post within that folder.\nThis is step one.\nThe second step is to then create different tiers of folders \nfor your posts to be organized within. When you click on \na hashtag on any social platform, you can see how many \npeople are currently using that hashtag. What you want \nto do is tag your posts with a blend of both large, popular \nhashtags and smaller, niche hashtags. For example, #writ -\ning is typically a very large folder because it’s so broad. A lot \nof different types of content could be tagged #writing—\nwhich means even though you’ll be tapping into a wider \nnet of people, you’ll also be reaching a more generalized \naudience. But #businesswriting or #fictionwriting are more \nspecific. They’re smaller, in the sense that they’re niches \nand not broad, all-encompassing categories, which means \nthe audiences you’ll be tapping into are slightly smaller but \npotentially more relevant.\nThe reason I like tagging posts with both broad and niche \nhashtags is because it gives each post a chance to be \nexposed to the masses, and to be found by highly targeted \nreaders. We’ll talk more about this in the next section, but \nthe entire secret to getting exposure on your writing online \nis to find as many ways as possible to make your writing \nresonate both on a broad level and with a specific audience  \nat the same time. This is one of those ways.\n\n--- Page 145 ---\n\n137\nChapter 5Publishing Hacking\nOne of the biggest benefits to building a vast library of \ncontent for yourself is the fact that you can continue to \nleverage that library over and over again.\nThere are three different components to Publishing Hack -\ning. But in order to understand the best way of doing this, \nlet me clarify the difference between “publishing” and \n“sharing.”\nPublishing is the first time you are putting a specific piece \nof content on one specific platform. Most websites put \nthis in their terms of service, and will eventually flag you \nfor publishing the same content over and over again. For \nexample, on Quora you can’t copy/paste the same answer \nto dozens and dozens of different questions. On Medium, \nyou can’t publish the same article more than once. Even \non most websites and major publications, you can’t have \nthe same article appear in multiple places unless the \npublication facilitates this on your behalf (which is called \n“syndicating”). So, when in doubt, you’ll only want to \npublish a piece of content once per platform—including on \nyour own website.\nSharing, on the other hand, is the act of taking the link to \nthe original post and recirculating it across various social \nplatforms.\nThis is what so many companies don’t seem to understand \nabout social media marketing, and the incredible return \non investment (ROI) that comes with writing online. The \nbigger you build your library of content, especially when \nyour content is more timeless than timely , the more you \ncan continue to engage your audience well into the future. \n\n--- Page 146 ---\n\n138\nChapter 5There’s nothing wrong with sharing an article you wrote \nthree years ago—especially if it’s a great article.\nThe three ways you can then leverage your library of con -\ntent and “hack” the publishing landscape are:\n1. Delete your original post, change a variable \nor two, and publish it again.\nWhen you publish something to the internet, there are \na million variables that dictate whether or not that piece \nsuccessfully catches fire.\nMaybe you published it during an unlucky time of day. \nMaybe your original title didn’t have the right hook. Maybe \nyou realized after the fact that your post could have been \nflushed out further. Whatever the reason, there are no \nrules against deleting your original post and republishing \nit with a different set of variables. On Quora, this might \nmean publishing your answer to a different question. On \nMedium, this might mean changing the headline and \nadding it to a different publication. On Twitter, this might \nmean using different hashtags.\nThe only exception to this rule is if that piece was pub -\nlished on someone else’s website or a major publication. \nOnce something goes live in those environments, deleting \nit becomes a massive hassle and is extremely frowned \nupon. The reason is because as soon as a piece is live, it’s \nnow fair game to be shared and linked to—and what web -\nsites and publications want to avoid is a scenario where \naudience members have already shared or linked to your \ncontent, only for your article or story to be taken down and \nthe link to send people to a dead web page.\n\n--- Page 147 ---\n\n139\nChapter 5This same risk also comes with social environments, in \nthe sense that if I write something on Medium and a few \npeople share it on Twitter, then when I choose to delete it, \nthose links are now going to be dead. So the pro/con here \nis to weigh whether or not the original post accumulated \nenough attention to warrant “trying again.”\nMy personal advice is to avoid publishing and deleting \ncontent as often as possible. Instead, I’m a big believer in \njust re-writing a new and improved version and publishing \na second piece instead. This way, your library continues \nto expand (opposed to you constantly playing this game \nof create/delete/create/delete). If you are going to delete \na piece, do it within the first 24-48 hours to minimize the \nnumber of people who may be sharing it or linking to it.\n2. Build syndication relationships with websites \nand major publications, and get around the \n“duplicate content” rule.\n“Syndication” is when major publications build partnerships \nwith each other to share popular content.\nFor example, I wrote an article in 2016 for Inc Magazine  \ntitled, 7 Crucial Lessons People Often Learn Too Late In Life. \nThe article did well on Inc and accumulated around 70,000 \nviews. But it wasn’t until Business Insider  syndicated the \narticle that it really caught fire. The first time that article \ngot syndicated, it accumulated more than 3,000,000 views. \nSix months later, Business Insider  deleted it (see: above \ntactic) and republished it again, this time accumulating \nmore than 5,000,000 views. They chose to delete and \nrepublish it in order to make this clearly proven content \nseem as though it was a brand-new article on their site.\n\n--- Page 148 ---\n\n140\nChapter 5This is what I mean when I say that luck plays a major role \nin how well your content performs. On Inc, the article went \nmini-viral, but because it didn’t scratch 100,000 views, \nI thought it wasn’t a winner. Then it got syndicated by \nBusiness Insider  and it went crazy. Which is why it’s to your \nadvantage to have your content appear in as many places \nas possible on the internet. You never know which environ -\nment is going to be the one that makes it “go.”\nHowever, the “con” of this strategy is what’s known as \n“duplicate content.” And since this is the most heavily \ndebated topic in all of content marketing and digital pub -\nlishing, it’s important to understand why I fundamentally \ndisagree with the duplicate content argument—and why \nI believe syndication is one of the greatest publishing hacks \non the internet.\n“Duplicate content” is the terminology Google uses to \nexplain their ranking system—and their dislike for seeing \nthe same exact content on multiple websites.\nThe only time you should be worrying about duplicate \ncontent (which means: the same exact content appear -\ning on multiple, different websites) is if you are writing \nwith a heavy focus on SEO—meaning you are running \na website and blog, which is your business , and you are \ncompeting for very specific search terms.\nIf this is the case, then going back to what I explained \nat the very beginning of this book, you are not “writing \nonline.” You are blogging. For example, let’s say you’re \na life insurance company that wants to rank for the key -\nphrase “life insurance for seniors.” The goal here would be \nto write a blog post that ranks for that specific keyphrase, \nso when a potential customer goes to Google and searches \n\n--- Page 149 ---\n\n141\nChapter 5“life insurance for seniors,” your blog post pops up first.\nThe reason you wouldn’t want this sort of blog post to be \nsyndicated elsewhere is because the entire purpose of writ -\ning in this context is to drive sales for the company. You \ndon’t really care how many people read this poetic excur -\nsion of yours on the benefits of “life insurance for seniors.” \nAll you care about is converting potential customers into \npaying customers. If this is the goal, you’re actually going \nto spend less time writing and publishing new content, and \nmore time getting other websites to backlink to that one \nindividual post, telling Google it is “the best” article on \nthe internet for that particular topic and keyphrase. This is \nhow SEO works.\nIf you do not fall into this category of bloggers, then you \naren’t going to be actively optimizing one single post for \nsearch. And if you aren’t actively optimizing one single \npost for search, then you gain almost nothing keeping it \nexclusively on your site—because you are never going to \nout-compete other blogs (businesses) for the keywords and \nkeyphrases in your article.\nIn short: writers who fear “duplicate content” think they’re \ndoing the right thing, not realizing they’re actually playing \na completely different game.\nKnowing I was never trying to write the #1 ranking blog \npost for any given keyword or keyphrase, I threw my \n“duplicate content” fears out the window and went all-in on \noptimizing for reach. I wanted as many different platforms, \nwith as many different types of audiences, sharing and \nconsuming my content. Whether they read my article on \nQuora or Inc Magazine  or my website didn’t matter.\n\n--- Page 150 ---\n\n142\nChapter 5What mattered is that they read it, period—and learned \nwho I was as a result.\nThe beginner version  of this strategy is to post every \nsingle article you write on every single social platform you \ncan. Every time I write an answer on Quora, for example, \nI will copy/paste that answer, give it a headline, and also \npublish it on Medium. Then I’ll take that Medium article, \ncopy/paste it, and publish it on LinkedIn. And I’ll keep \ndoing this with as many social platforms as I can, where \npublishing articles of that quality is acceptable. (You can \nalso take this a step further, group articles together, and \npublish them as eBooks on Wattpad and Amazon, so long \nas the content is yours.)\nYes, the headlines can be the exact same. No, you don’t \nneed to do anything special like change any of the content \nfor SEO purposes—since you aren’t playing the SEO game \nto begin with. All you’re doing is sharing your article in \ndifferent environments, each of which have different eco -\nsystems and audiences.\nThe advanced version  of this strategy is to reach out \nto websites and publications and let them know you are \nwriting content that aligns with their target audience, and \nthat you’d be willing to let them syndicate your content for \nfree. The reason so many writers don’t do this is because, \nfor one, they don’t know they can, and two, they have this \negoic belief they should be paid by publications for their \nwriting. I have always found this mentality to be incredibly \nshort-sighted. As an up-and-coming writer, I didn’t want \n$100 in exchange for an article. What I wanted was for the \npublication to open the floodgates and syndicate dozens and \ndozens of my articles, giving me free marketing, exposure, \nand Perceived Credibility.\n\n--- Page 151 ---\n\n143\nChapter 5The most effective way to do this is find someone on \nLinkedIn or Twitter who works for the website or publica -\ntion, and ideally has “partnerships” somewhere in their job \ndescription. Send them a message and say something like:\nHey there,\nMy name is Nicolas Cole, and I actively write \nabout personal development habits on Quora \nand Medium. Since your publication specializes \nin personal development content, I would love to \nfind a way to collaborate. I’m very passionate \nabout sharing new ideas with people looking to \nbetter themselves, and I was wondering if you \nwould be interested in syndicating my content \nfor free.\nHere are a few of my most popular articles \nI believe would resonate with your audience:\n• Link\n• Link\n• Link\nLet me know if you’d like to republish any of \nthese! And if this sounds interesting, but these \naren’t the right fit, just let me know and I’m \nhappy to send you other articles as well.\nNow, most standard websites and conventional blogs \nprobably aren’t going to want to syndicate your content—\nagain, because they fear “duplicate content” penalties \nfrom Google. But major publications actively syndicate \ncontent from social sites such as Quora, Medium, Linke -\ndIn, even Facebook and Twitter, and sometimes have \n\n--- Page 152 ---\n\n144\nChapter 5entire departments dedicated to syndicating content onto \ntheir sites. They are going to be the most receptive to your \noutreach—especially if you are writing content that speaks \ndirectly to their audience, and you have metrics to prove \nreadership.\nThis strategy is how I was able to get nearly one hundred \narticles syndicated from Quora into major publications \nsuch as Forbes, Fortune, TIME, The Chicago Tribune , etc. \nAnd, this strategy is how I have continued to extend my \nreach as a writer years later. Thrive Global actively syndi -\ncates my Medium content. So does The Ladders.\nAll you have to do is build the partnership yourself.\nThe expert version  of this strategy is the advanced ver -\nsion at the publication level.\nThis is a publishing growth hack both writers and compa -\nnies can use, and it’s incredibly powerful. Basically, instead \nof being seen as “a writer” asking publications to syndicate \nyour content, you can build your own website, brand it as \na publication, and then forge syndication partnerships with \nother websites and publications as “a publication” yourself.\nThe reason this strategy works so well is because the inter -\nnet is a perception game. If I reach out to Business Insider  \nand ask them to syndicate my content, they might say \nyes—especially if I’m a proven, popular writer online. But \na completely different perception is communicated when \nI say, “Hey there, my name is Cole and I’m heading up the \npartnerships division of a new life advice publication. I was \nwondering if you’d be open to syndicating content from \nour site?” Now, all of a sudden, Business Insider  isn’t chat -\nting with Cole, the writer. They’re having a very serious \n\n--- Page 153 ---\n\n145\nChapter 5conversation with Cole, the partnerships coordinator, rep -\nresenting an emerging publication.\nObviously there are nuances here. The content you’re \npublishing has to be good enough for the publication to \nsyndicate. The content has to align with their core audi -\nence. The content has to both be different enough to be \nunique, but similar enough to fit within their general \nstyle guide. But if these things are all true, a major pub -\nlication has no reason to decline your free content. No, it \nwon’t rank very well on Google, but it’s another headline \nthey can share on social media, another page view, and \nanother attempt at “spinning the wheel.” And since major \npublications live and die by website traffic and advertising \nrevenue, the more content, the better.\nOnce you’ve created a separate website and publication \n(which is literally nothing more than a professional-looking \nSquarespace or Wordpress theme and a bunch of well-writ -\nten articles from a handful of different authors), you can \nstart plugging your own content into the mix. You can write \nan answer on Quora. You can copy/paste that answer and \npublish it as an article on Medium. You can copy/paste that \narticle and publish it again on LinkedIn, and then you can \ncopy/paste that article on LinkedIn onto your brand-new \npublication, before passing the link along to your point of \ncontact at a major publication, eager to syndicate your con -\ntent. The best part about this strategy is that you can create \nas many syndication partnerships as you want. So, in theory, \nfive major publications can all syndicate with your website, \nand all five can syndicate the exact same article—which can \nalso appear on your social platforms as well.\nThis is how you quadruple dip in the world of online pub -\nlishing.\n\n--- Page 154 ---\n\n146\nChapter 5T o recap:\n• You can publish anything you write in \ninfinite social environments (Quora, Medium, \nLinkedIn, Wattpad, excerpts on Twitter and \nFacebook, etc.).\n• You can publish articles in infinite social \nenvironments and forge partnerships with \npublications to syndicate your content \ndirectly (content originally published on \nQuora can be syndicated into major publi -\ncations like Inc, Forbes, TIME , etc., IF you \nfacilitate it yourself by reaching out to some -\none on their syndication/partnerships team).\n• You can publish articles in infinite social \nenvironments, and publish them on a web -\nsite/publication you own, and syndicate \nthem to infinite publications you have part -\nnerships with.\n• If you author an article on a major publi -\ncation first, that article can be republished \non your own social profiles (so long as you \ninclude a link at the bottom to the original).\n• If you author an article on a major publica -\ntion first, that article can be republished on \nyour own publication (so long as you include \na link at the bottom to the original), allow -\ning it to be syndicated to other publications \nyou have partnerships with. Some publica -\ntions are OK with this, some aren’t.\n\n--- Page 155 ---\n\n147Chapter  6\nHow To Always Write \nSomething People Will Want \nTo Read: 5 Forms Of Proven \nWriting\nThere are five types of writing on the internet.\nForm #1:  Actionable Guide\nForm #2:  Opinion\nForm #3: Curated List\nForm #4: Story\nForm #5: Credible Talking Head\nEvery time you come across an article, a social media post, \na free email course, an eBook, etc., I want you to pause \nand ask the question, “What type of writing is this?” Once \nyou start to see all the different variations these five forms \ncan take on, you will have a greater sense of clarity around \nwhat it is you’re trying to accomplish every time you sit \ndown to write.\nThe way you “win” the game of online writing is by \ncreating the single best possible version  of whatever \nform of writing you’re using in your chosen category.\n\n--- Page 156 ---\n\n148\nChapter 6For example, let’s say you want to write a How To guide \non how to  become a freelance photographer. The very first \nquestion you should ask is, “What type of writing is this?” \nThe answer should be obvious: you’re trying to write an \n“actionable guide.” (Tip: “how to” is a dead giveaway you \nshould be using the Actionable Guide form.)\nThe second question you should ask is, “How can I make \nthis the ULTIMATE guide to writing online?” Your goal \nshould be to create a guide so specific , so comprehensive , so \ninformative , that the moment a reader starts reading what \nyou’ve written, they will immediately 1) bookmark it, 2) \nshare it with someone else, and 3) feel as though they don’t \nneed to go read any other guides, articles, or eBooks on the \nsame topic.\nNothing could possibly be “better” than what you’ve written.\nThis requires research. It’s nearly impossible to know \nwhether or not you’ve successfully “beaten” the competi -\ntion if you have no idea who your competition is in the first \nplace. So, poke around the internet. Google the topic you \nwant to write about, along with a handful of related topics. \nRead a few other people’s “ultimate guides,” and see if you \ncan pinpoint where they went wrong, or where you (as the \nreader) wished they had gone more in depth.\nOnce you’ve done your due diligence and have a good \nsense of what you think you need to do to make your piece \nof writing the single best resource on the entire internet for \nthat particular topic , the third question you need to ask \nyourself is, “Can I make this more specific? Am I trying to \ncram too much into one article?”\n\n--- Page 157 ---\n\n149\nChapter 6In order to create the single best resource , you do not need \nto write a book. In fact, I have always argued that length \nis a poor judge of value (the only time this backfired was \nwhen a hot-shot restaurateur and potential client said to \nme, “That’s not what my girlfriend thinks,” but that’s a \nstory for another time). You aren’t aiming for a word count. \nWhat you’re aiming for is the most value you can possibly \ndeliver WITHOUT 1) confusing the reader, or 2) wasting \ntheir time.\nThe usual mistake writers make here is they try to fit too \nmany ideas into one single piece of content. Instead of \nwriting the single best article  on “How To Land Your First \nClient As A Freelance Photographer,” they write an article \nthat touches a bit on clients, and a bit on lenses, and a bit \non accounting, and a bit on photo editing. Even though the \ntitle is telling the reader, “I’m about to give you an Action -\nable Guide,” they’ve unconsciously written a Curated List \ninstead—leaving their reader confused and unfulfilled.\nAnytime you fail to deliver on your promise to a reader, \nyou’ve lost them.\nInstead, you should write one article exclusively about \n“How To Land Your First Client As A Freelance Photogra -\npher.” If any thought, insight, opinion, statistic, story, or \nrandom anecdote doesn’t have to do with that one specific \ntopic, it shouldn’t be in the piece. Period. “How To Choose \nYour First Lens As A Freelance Photographer” should be \na second, separate article. “How To Handle Your Own \nAccounting As A Freelance Photographer” should be a \nthird, separate article. And so on, ensuring the promise \nyou make to your reader is delivered on to the very best of \nyour ability.\n\n--- Page 158 ---\n\n150\nChapter 6Here’s how to do this for all five of the different writing \nforms.\nActionable Guide\nAgain, the goal of writing an Actionable Guide of any kind \nis to get someone to bookmark it.\nThe reason I like to set this as a “mental goal” is because if \nyou can write something someone is willing to bookmark, \nthat means you’ve written a resource the reader doesn’t \nwant to just read once—but wants to come back to again \nand again (and not just to that individual piece, but to you \nas a writer).\nThere are a handful of ways you can make your Actionable \nGuide “better” than the competition:\n• “Better” Quality:  If everyone else writes short \nguides that don’t go into very much detail, you \ncan be the one to write long, insightful, walk -\nthrough-style guides. Conversely, if everyone \nelse writes long, boring, walkthrough-style \nguides, you can be the one to condense them \ninto shorter, more digestible bites.\n• “Better” Voice: If everyone else’s How To \nguides are dense and overwhelming, you \ncan show up to the party and be fast, full of \npersonality, and overly casual. Conversely, if \neveryone else’s How To guides are so casual \nyou feel as though you aren’t being given pro -\nfessional insight, you can be the one to write in \na more formal way.\n\n--- Page 159 ---\n\n151\nChapter 6• “Better” Organization: If everyone else writes \nreally great material, but it’s organized poorly \nand full of huge paragraphs and no subheads or \npage breaks for the reader, you can win simply \nby organizing your writing more visually and \n“appearing” easier to read and understand.\n• “Better” Positioned: If everyone else is writ -\ning about the same problem, you can flip the \nproblem on its head to be seen as something \nradically different. For example, if there are \na million guides all titled “How To Get Your \nFirst Client As A Freelance Photographer,” you \ncan position yourself differently by reframing \nthe problem: “Freelance Photographers, Here’s \nWhy You Don’t Want To Charge Your First \nClient Any Money At All.”\n• “Better” For The Audience: If everyone else \nis writing about their industry from a broad \nperspective, you can stand out by choosing not \nto use universal language and using extremely \nspecific terminology and vernacular only that \nspecific audience would understand—and vice \nversa, if everyone else writes exclusively for \nthe niche, you can stand out by writing for a \nbroader, more universal audience.\n• “Better” Experience: If everyone else writes \nas if they are trying to hard-sell readers into \nbuying a product or course, only giving them \n10% of the information they actually need and \nhoping they’ll pay for the other 90%, you can \nstand out by giving away that same information \n(and then some) for free.\n\n--- Page 160 ---\n\n152\nChapter 6Opinion\nOpinion pieces are, without question, the most popular \ntype of written content on the internet.\nUnfortunately, because opinions are so easy to write and \nshare, they are also least likely to stand out because, well, \neveryone has one. The reason opinions often go unheard is \nbecause the people writing them think that “just having an \nopinion” is the most important measure of success. It’s not. \nOpinions, just like Actionable Guides, have their own set of \nrules—and if you want to avoid being another navel-gazing \nblogger nobody cares to listen to, you need to find different \nways to communicate in order to stand out.\nThe techniques listed above for Actionable Guides work \nwell for Opinions, Curated Lists, Stories, and Credibility \npieces, so I won’t repeat them. Below are additional tech -\nniques that work well for Opinion writing.\n• “Better” Data:  If everyone else’s opinions \nare shot from the hip and aren’t backed by \nanything substantial, this is your opportunity \nto show up to the party with a satchel full of \nfacts. Conversely, if the most popular opinions \non a particular topic are overloaded with facts \nand statistics making them difficult to read, \nyou can be the one to write an entire piece \naround one single fact and make the topic \nmore digestible.\n• “Better” Quotes:  If everyone else is only \nwriting their own opinions, you can be the one \nto amplify your opinions by curating credible, \ninsightful quotes from other relevant voices.\n\n--- Page 161 ---\n\n153\nChapter 6• “Better” Insight:  If everyone else is keep -\ning the conversation within the commonly \naccepted rules of the industry, you can \npresent insight from outside the industry \nand expand the conversation to bigger and \nbroader audiences. (And vice versa: if every -\none is sharing big, broad opinions, you can \nbe the one to bring the topic back to one key \ninsight.)\n• “Better” Stories:  If everyone else is sharing \nopinions citing facts or personal beliefs, you \ncan reframe the conversation by telling a \nunique story that underscores the point you’re \ntrying to make. (Writers like Ryan Holiday \ndo this often, where they will tell the reader \na story about someone famous or noteworthy \nfrom history, and then after telling the story \nthey will expand upon the story with their \nown personal opinions and insights.)  \n• “Better” Clarity:  If everyone else’s opinions \nare murky, disorganized, or unnecessarily \ncomplicated, you have an opportunity to \nmake things simple for readers. What really \nmatters here? Why? And how can you say it \nin a way where a single sentence rings louder \nthan an entire essay on the topic? (For exam -\nple: Tweets that go massively viral aren’t just \n“clever” or “punchy.” They’re clear. They reso -\nnate with so many people because they bring \na massive amount of clarity to an opinion \neveryone else seems to be overcomplicating.)\n\n--- Page 162 ---\n\n154\nChapter 6Curated List\nEver since the dawn of BuzzFeed, lists on the internet have \ngotten a bad reputation.\nPeople associate lists with “clickbait.” And yes, if the title \nis “13 Bathing Suits Britney Spears Wore That Reveal The \nShape Of Her Nipples,” then we’re in clickbait territory. \nBut the truth is, a “list” is just another way of organizing \ninformation. Who is running for president in the upcoming \nelection is a “list.” Which books you should read in order to \nbecome a more well-rounded human being is a “list.” The \ngreatest basketball players of all time is a “list.”\nIn order for your list to not be clickbait, but actually be \nmeaningful and valuable to a reader, you need two things: \nSpecificity and Speed.\nSpecificity  is how relevant the examples you’re choosing \nin your list are to the target reader. For example, if I’m \nwriting a list of productivity hacks (whether it’s an arti -\ncle, or a series of Tweets, or a chapter within an eBook) \nand half the items on that list aren’t really productivity \nhacks, but time management techniques, well then the \nreader is going to feel sort of lied to. They were promised \n“productivity hacks,” and I gave them “time management \ntechniques” instead. Or, if I’m writing a list of vampire \nbooks you absolutely have to read, but three of the books \non the list aren’t vampire books but werewolf books, the \nreader is going to be pissed—and will most likely voice \ntheir frustration in the comments.\nSpeed  is then how quickly you are revealing new, import -\nant information to the reader. What makes a list “work” is \nthe fact that it has the potential to pack a ton of valuable \n\n--- Page 163 ---\n\n155\nChapter 6information into a very short period of time. Again, if \nI love young adult fiction and I want to know which vam -\npire books I should read this summer, the information I’m \ninterested in (as a reader) is 1) which books, and 2) a quick \nsummary of what each book is about so I can determine \nwhich one I want to read first. Anything beyond that is \nunnecessary, and not why a reader is reading this list in \nthe first place.\nWriters go wrong by trying to have one without the other. \nThey optimize for speed, but sacrifice substance—or they \noptimize for substance, but sacrifice speed.\nAn example of the former would be, “3 Things You Need \nTo Know About Business,” with the three things being \n1) You need to work hard, 2) You need to make a profit, \nand 3) You need to be successful. That list might have \nspeed, but it’s essentially worthless to the reader—there \nisn’t enough specificity (in the title, and in the article \nitself), which means there is very little substance. An \nexample of the latter would be, “3 Things You Need To \nKnow Before Starting Your First Business,” with the three \nthings being 1) How to form an LLC, 2) How to do your \nown accounting, and 3) How to land your first client. Here, \nthe information is more specific and relevant to the target \nreader, but if it’s executed in a long, drawn-out, rambling \nsort of way, the reader isn’t going to read the entire thing.\nThey’re going to look for a “better” version.\n\n--- Page 164 ---\n\n156\nChapter 6In addition to Specificity and Speed, techniques for making \nyour Curated Lists “better” than the competition (in addi -\ntion to the techniques we’ve covered above) are:\n• “Better” Examples:  If everyone else is using \ncliché examples—Michael Jordan, Wayne \nGretzky, Tiger Woods—you can differen -\ntiate yourself by using lesser known, more \nunconventional examples specifically from \nseemingly irrelevant categories .\n• “Better” Structure: If everyone else’s lists \nare numbered subheads followed by big, \nblocky paragraphs, your lists can appear \ndifferent just by organizing the information \nin a cleaner way. Maybe you have a subhead, \nand then one single sentence of description, \nbefore moving on to the next subhead and \nimportant piece of information (incredibly \nfast Rate of Revelation). And vice versa, if \neveryone else’s lists are short and very sur -\nface level, there’s an opportunity for you to \nexpand upon each numbered point in more \ndepth.\n• “Better” Subheads: If everyone else is using \nsingle-word subheads, why not make your \nsubheads entire sentences? If everyone else \nis using broad statements as subheads, why \nnot make yours more specific? (This has \nbecome a big differentiator for me in my \nown writing. All of my best-performing lists \nused this technique where each subhead was \na sentence/thought in itself, so that if all \n\n--- Page 165 ---\n\n157\nChapter 6a reader did was skim the subheads, they’d \nget the gist of the entire article.)\n• “Better” Introduction: If everyone else \ntreats lists as nothing more than a “listing” \nof information, you have the opportunity \nto frame your list differently by adding a \nthoughtful introduction. What makes this list \ndifferent? Where is this coming from? Who \nare you to be curating this information for \nthe reader? What’s your intention in pulling \nall this information together? Sharing your \npoint of view as a writer is a powerful mech -\nanism for giving new context to what might \nbe conventional wisdom.\nStory\nStories aren’t just for fiction writers.\nStories are one of the most powerful ways to “hook” \na reader into your piece of writing. The goal of any story \nshould be to move a reader’s eyes along the page so quickly \nthat before they can even think to themselves, “Do I want \nto read this?” they’re already off and running.\nThis was a technique I witnessed very quickly on Quora, \nand it has become a staple for any high-performing writer \non that platform. The answers with the most engagement \nalmost always begin at the absolute height of the story: \n“The first time I became a millionaire, I was living in my \nparents’ basement.” Boom. You’re in the story before you’ve \neven decided whether or not you wanted to be there in the \nfirst place.\n\n--- Page 166 ---\n\n158\nChapter 6Writer and marketer, Josh Fechter, took this strategy and \napplied it to writing on LinkedIn—and in 2018 actually \n“broke” LinkedIn’s algorithm, accumulating hundreds of \nmillions of views on his long-form status updates. While \neveryone else was writing short, “Here’s what I’m thinking” \nupdates, he started writing short stories about business and \nentrepreneurship with an insanely high Rate of Revelation. \nWhen everyone else was writing and sharing dense para -\ngraphs (as most people do when writing a status update \non social media), he gave every single sentence of his short \nstories its own paragraph. His writing on LinkedIn looked \nmore like a haiku than a status update.\nAll these little choices he made were ways his writing \nbecame “better” than everyone else’s—and he beat the \ngame as a result.\nTechniques for making your Stories “better” than the com -\npetition (in addition to all the other techniques described \nabove) are:\n• “Better” Openers:  If everyone else is taking \ntheir sweet time getting to the point, blow \nright past them and start writing at the \nmoment of conflict or achievement. (Every \nsingle sentence you write online, you are \nfighting for the reader’s attention. If your \nstory “gets better” four paragraphs later, \ndelete your first four paragraphs. You don’t \nneed them.)\n• “Better” Transitions: If everyone else is \nwriting long-winded, overly descriptive, and \nslow-as-molasses prose, do the opposite. Tell \nan entire story in four sentences. Add a page \n\n--- Page 167 ---\n\n159\nChapter 6break. And then move on to the next pow -\nerful story or thought. There are no rules \nin writing. All that matters is you keep the \nreader’s eyes moving down the page.\n• “Better” Characters:  If everyone else in \nyour niche or genre names their characters \nregular names like John and Sarah, name \nyour characters XY-2 and UU-5. If everyone \nelse’s characters have regular hobbies like \nplaying soccer or the guitar, give your char -\nacters more unique hobbies like tie-dying \nsafari hats. Whether you’re creating fictional \ncharacters in your imagination, or choosing \ntrue stories to retell, you always want to be \nsearching for the unconventional. Remem -\nber: what’s expected is boring. What’s \nunexpected  is exciting, new, and different.\n• “Better” Language: If everyone else is \nwriting in formal English with perfect \ngrammar, try writing in a dialect only your \nmost loyal readers will understand. Maybe \nyou intentionally never use commas because \nthat’s your style. Maybe you intentionally \noveruse the word ‘like’ because, like, you \nwant to sound like a valley girl because like, \nthat would just be just like so perfect for \nyour story. (The book Clockwork Orange  is \na terrific example of how language can be \nmanipulated to create a cult following and a \nvery special relationship with your readers.)  \n\n--- Page 168 ---\n\n160\nChapter 6• “Better” Category: If everyone else is \nwriting conventional sci-fi, you should be \nthe one to write Education Sci-Fi, where you \nteach readers different subject matters but in \nfuturistic terms, settings, etc. Or, if everyone \nelse is writing cooking recipes with a few \npersonal anecdotes, you should be the one to \nwrite Recipes That Became Family Stories—\ngiving the reader a recipe they can make \nthemselves, but also telling them the ridic -\nulous time Uncle Larry tried to make apple \npie and ended up at the grocery store at 1:00 \na.m., hammered, arguing with the cashier \nlady about how NASA has never actually been \nto the moon and they staged the whole thing \non live television . Writing that truly “stands \nout” always lives in a fundamentally differ -\nent category.\nCredible Talking Head\nAnd finally, there are things on the internet that get read \nsimply because they’re “the most credible.”\nWhen a news story breaks, people want to know what \nthe New York Times  has to say about it. When the NBA \nannounces they’re going to change a rule, the world wants \nto know how Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Shaquille O’Neal, \nand other former professional basketball players feel about \n“how the game has changed.” When a new pharmaceutical \ndrug hits the market, readers want to know what doctors \nhave to say about it. And when you want to know how to \nstart writing online, the first question you ask yourself is, \n“Who should I turn to for advice? Who is the most credible ?”\n\n--- Page 169 ---\n\n161\nChapter 6Your goal as a writer is to always be looking for the topics, \nsubject matters, and categories you are most qualified to \nwrite within.\n“Write what you know,” as the adage goes.\nSometimes, your credibility informs what it is you write \nabout (you’re the Head of Marketing for a startup, and so \nyou believe you’re qualified to write about marketing). \nOther times, what you write about informs how and where \nyou need to build your credibility. For example, I started \nwriting about personal development on Quora when I was \n24 years old. I wasn’t some highly qualified life coach or \nesteemed motivational speaker giving advice. I didn’t have \nany credibility at all. But the more I wrote, and the more \npeople read my writing, and the more publications repub -\nlished my work, the more I “grew into” my credibility.\nTechniques for making any of your writing that leans on \nCredibility “better” than the competition (in addition to all \nthe other techniques described above) are:\n• “Better” Association: If everyone else \nis writing only about their own personal \nexperiences, write about your personal \nexperiences being surrounded by or spend -\ning time with Barack Obama, Bill Gates, \nBrad Pitt, Halle Berry, or whoever else is \nseen as credible in your chosen category . \n(Name-dropping is one of the fastest ways \nto tell a reader, “I know what I’m talking \nabout.”)\n• “Better” Context:  If everyone else is giving \nadvice or sharing their opinions, you should \n\n--- Page 170 ---\n\n162\nChapter 6be the one to give context as to why your \nadvice, opinion, or story is different. For \nexample, it’s one thing for me to say, “There \nare 5 things you need to know about ghost -\nwriting for executives.” But, it’s much more \npowerful if I say, “I learned a lot building \na multi-million-dollar ghostwriting company, \nand let me tell you, there are 5 things you \nneed to know about ghostwriting for execu -\ntives.” That one small addition of credibility \ncompletely changes the context of everything \nthat follows.\n• “Better” Arguments: If everyone else is \njust stating the facts, or shooting opinions \nfrom the hip, you can be the one to challenge \nconventional wisdom. Instead of writing \nabout what to do, write about what not to do. \nInstead of talking about things people should \nlearn, talk about what things most people \nnever  learn—and fail as a result. Reframing \na topic is a powerful way of communicating \nto readers that you know something most \nother people in your chosen category  do not.\n• “Better” Perception:  If everyone else’s \neBook covers look like all the other eBooks \nin your chosen category , go seek out \na designer who has a polar-opposite style so \nthat your eBook looks nothing like the com -\npetition. If everyone else’s photos on social \nmedia look cheap and amateurish, save \nup some money and invest in professional \nphotos, making yourself look like you’ve got \n\n--- Page 171 ---\n\n163\nChapter 6a massive publishing house behind you (even \nif you don’t). The more ways you can present \nyourself as “unlike the rest,” the better.\n\n--- Page 172 ---\n\n164Chapter  7\nThe Perfect Post: How To \nWrite Headlines People Can’t \nHelp But Read\nEvery form of online writing has a headline.\nThe first sentence of your Facebook post or Tweet is \n“a headline.”\nThe title and subtitle of your Wattpad or Amazon eBook is \n“a headline.”\nThe front page of your company website is “a headline.”\nWhy people read certain things on the internet and not \nothers is often a reflection of its headline. That string of \nfive to fifteen words at the very top of the page tells the \nreader whether the piece of writing in front of them is \ngoing to be worth their time—and what they can expect in \nexchange for reading it.\nWhat makes a great headline is getting someone to \nunderstand three things at the exact same time:\n1. What this piece of writing is about\n2. Who this piece of writing is for\n3. The PROMISE: the problem that will be \nsolved, and/or the solution being offered\n\n--- Page 173 ---\n\n165\nChapter 7This is what’s known as The Curiosity Gap.\nThe Curiosity Gap is what tells the reader what this piece \nof writing is about, who it’s for, and what it’s promising—\nall without revealing the answer.\nWhen it comes to headlines, writers will often aim to write \nsomething “creative” or “clever,” failing to realize that \ntrue creativity is actually the art of clarity . If you’re vague, \npeople won’t know what it is you’re writing about. If you’re \nunspecific, they won’t know it’s for them. And if your PROM -\nISE isn’t compelling enough, they won’t give it any attention.\nFor example, a headline like “The Big Idea” is ineffective \nbecause it doesn’t tell the reader 1) what it’s about, 2) who \nit’s for, or 3) what it’s promising in exchange.\nHere’s how we fix it:\n• “The Big Idea That Needs To Get Through \nPoliticians’ Heads To Fix Racial Inequal -\nity In America”  is clearer. As a reader, you \nnow know exactly what this piece is about.\n• “3 Big Ideas From Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, \nAnd Jeff Bezos That Changed The World \nForever”  is more specific. If you’re inter -\nested in creativity and business, you know \nthis article was written for you.\n• “This 1 Big Idea Will Change The Way You \nThink About College”  is a big PROMISE. \nThis headline tells the reader, “The way you \nthink about college will no longer be the \nsame after you read this article.”\n\n--- Page 174 ---\n\n166\nChapter 7And you better deliver on that PROMISE—otherwise read -\ners are going to call your writing “clickbait.”\n(People think “clickbait” refers to the headline style that uses \nnumbers: 7 Things, 6 Ways, 3 Mistakes, etc. It’s not. These \nheadline styles are extremely effective as long as you keep \nyour PROMISE to the reader . It’s when you don’t keep your \nPROMISE that the reader feels tricked—which leaves them \ndisappointed, angry, and “click-baited.”)\nNow, there are definitely some lazy, overly sensational \nexamples of The Curiosity Gap that writers on the internet \nuse all the time, and I don’t recommend them.\n• “You’ll Never Believe What Happened Next!”\n• “This CRAZY Situation Couldn’t Have Gotten \nANY WORSE”\n• “The Secret No One Wants You To Know...”\n“Better,” less clickbaity examples of The Curiosity Gap \nwould be headlines that more articulately speak to the \nintended audience, problem, and PROMISE.\n• “The 1 Mistake All New Project Manag -\ners Make—That Ends Up Costing Their \nCompany $500,000”\n• “7 Small But Meaningful Things You Can \nSay To Your Significant Other To Show How \nMuch You Love Them”\n• “How To Write Headlines That Go Viral, \nAccumulate Millions Of Page Views, And \nConvert Readers Into Loyal Customers”\n\n--- Page 175 ---\n\n167\nChapter 7What makes these headlines so powerful isn’t that they’re \n“creative” or “clever.” They’re powerful because they are \nclear in their intentions. You know exactly what each one \nof these pieces is going to be about before you even click \non it—which means, if a reader does choose to click on \nan article, they didn’t arrive there on accident. Something \nabout the headline spoke to them (and the more you write, \nand the more data you accumulate, you will begin to know \nwhich types of headlines speak to your target readers \nmost effectively).\nExpert-level examples of The Curiosity Gap are headlines \nthat find new, unique ways to achieve these same three \ngoals but by using new language, structures, or formats. \nBest-selling books do this masterfully. They combine an \noverarching main title with an ultra-specific subtitle to \ncreate a puzzle of intrigue.\nNonfiction Examples\n• “Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way To \nBuild Good Habits & Break Bad Ones”\n• “The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live \nAnywhere, And Join The New Rich”\n• “Play Bigger: How Pirates, Dreamers, And \nInnovators Create And Dominate Markets”\n\n--- Page 176 ---\n\n168\nChapter 7Fiction Examples\n• “The Book Thief” (Look at how much you can \nimagine about the story based off just those \nthree words!)\n• “Ready Player One” (Immediately tells \ngamers, “This is a book for you.”)\n• “The Martian” (When paired with a photo of \na human on Mars, the reader immediately \nknows “The Martian” isn’t some otherworldly \ncreature inhabiting earth—it’s actually about \na human inhabiting another planet.)\nWhat these titles have in common is they are executing \nThe Curiosity Gap with two puzzle pieces instead of just \none. On the nonfiction side, “Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, \nAnd Join The New Rich” is a great headline. But it’s a \n“better” headline by adding “The 4-Hour Workweek” in \nfront of it. There’s a clearer benefit, another PROMISE. \nAnd on the fiction side, the entire story arc is told in two \nor three carefully chosen words. It’s not just that the title is \n“catchy.” The reason these titles work is because the reader \nactually gets all three of their questions answered clearly:\n1. What is this about?\n2. Is this for me?\n3. What PROMISE are you making—and how \nconfident am I in your ability to deliver on \nthat PROMISE?\n\n--- Page 177 ---\n\n169\nChapter 7Who Are You Writing For?\nBefore you start writing anything , the very first thing you \nshould do is think deeply about the headline, the frame, \nand the focal point you are presenting to your reader.\nEven if you’re writing a 100-character Tweet, I encourage \nyou to question, “What would be the headline of this Tweet?”\nTo be honest, I used to write my headlines last. A younger \nme believed what mattered more was the content of what \nI was saying, and that the headline was basically just the \nbow I placed on top. Seven years later, I realized this was \nnot only incorrect, but incredibly unproductive. Your head -\nline isn’t just a headline. Your headline is, quite literally, \na micro-version of your entire Actionable Guide, Opinion, \nCurated List, Story, or Credible Talking Head monologue.\nIf you can’t clearly communicate what it is you want to say \nin a twelve-word headline, chances are, you won’t clearly \ncommunicate what it is you want to say in an 800-word \npost (or a 60,000-word book).\nThe first question I encourage you to ask yourself is, \n“Who is this piece of writing for?”\nOne of the biggest ironies when it comes to online writing \nis that people think Audience and Subject Matter are two \ncompletely separate variables. They sit down to write what -\never it is they want to write, and then, after the fact , they \nsay, “Ok now how do I get this in front of a billion people?”\nWhat these writers fail to realize is that Subject Matter is \nactually what defines  the size of their Audience.\n\n--- Page 178 ---\n\n170\nChapter 7The size of your audience is a direct reflection of the \nsize of the question you’re answering.\nFor example, very few people wake up in the morning \nand say to themselves, “Wow, I wonder what’s new in the \nworld of biotechnology.” Biotechnology is a niche. Which \nmeans, if you’re writing about what’s happening within the \nworld of biotechnology, your Audience will only be as big \nas the number of people actively asking themselves about \nbiotechnology .\nHowever, a lot more people wake up in the morning and \nask themselves, “How can I be happier in life? How do \nI know if I’m in a healthy relationship? How can I make \nmore money?”\nThese broader, more universal questions have much \nlarger Audiences—which means, by choosing Happiness, \nRelationships, or Money as your Subject Matter, you will \ninherently reach a wider Audience.\nBefore you begin writing anything, you need to decide \nwho you are writing for. And that decision needs to be \nclearly reflected in both the headline and the content of \nyour piece.\nAre you writing for the masses?  Do you want to try \nto reach as many people as possible? Then you need to \nanswer a universal question —something that will res -\nonate with anyone, no matter who they are or where \nthey’re from.\nAre you writing for a specific niche?  Are you less \nconcerned with reaching “everyone,” and more concerned \nwith reaching a specific type of person? Then you need to \n\n--- Page 179 ---\n\n171\nChapter 7answer a question highly relevant to that niche — \nsomething that will resonate meaningfully with your exact \ntarget reader (for example: someone deep in the field of \nbiotechnology).\nThis is true for both fiction and nonfiction. A story \ntitled, “The Day Humans Went Extinct” answers a much \nbroader question (“What happens if every human goes \nextinct?”) than a story titled, “The Day Vampires Went \nExtinct.” Why? Because the number of people who want to \nknow about the future of humans  is much larger than the \nnumber of people who want to know about the future of \nvampires . And even less people want to read a story titled, \n“The Day Caterpillar-Vampires Went Extinct.” As the size of \nthe question gets smaller, and the niche gets more specific, \nso does the size of your potential Audience.\nNow, there is a way for you to get the best of both \nworlds, and that’s by using niche topics to answer uni -\nversal questions.\nFor example, an article titled, “How To Be A Better Writer” \nanswers two of our three questions. You know who this \narticle is going to be for, and you know what it’s going \nto be about. Unfortunately, the PROMISE is a little weak. \nWhat does being a “better writer” really mean? What \nbenefits do you receive by becoming a better writer? Why \nshould someone want to become a “better writer” in the \nfirst place?\nHere is where you have a decision to make. You can either \nmake your PROMISE answer a niche question or a broad \nquestion—and depending on which you pick will dramat -\nically change the size of your potential Audience. (It will \nalso change the content of the piece.)\n\n--- Page 180 ---\n\n172\nChapter 7For example:\n“How To Be A Better Writer Today, So You Can Start \nWriting Best-Selling Books Tomorrow”  would be a title \nwith a big PROMISE for aspiring authors. If you have no \ninterest in becoming a best-selling author, you probably \nwon’t want to read this piece of writing. It’s more specific, \nand will resonate more clearly with your target reader, but \nit won’t reach as many different types of readers. This is \nthe pro/con.\n“How To Become A Better Writer, Journal More Often, \nAnd Live A More Present Life,”  on the other hand, has \na completely different PROMISE. The question it’s answer -\ning is dramatically bigger (“How can I live a more present \nlife?”). The Curiosity Gap here is saying that by becoming \na better writer , and using writing as a habit, you can live \na more present life.\nThis technique of tying niche topics to universal ques -\ntions is a powerful way of tapping into new audiences and \nexpanding your reach outside of your particular industry \nor category.\nHere are a few more examples:\n• “The Future Of The Biotechnology Industry” \nis niche (and vague), and can be expanded \nby changing it to “How The Future Of \nBiotechnology Is Going To Make All Of Us \nHappier, Healthier, And Live Longer.”\n• “The Girl Who Ran Away” is good, but it can be \nclarified and expanded by changing it to, “The \nGirl Who Ran Away: Family, Loss, And The \n\n--- Page 181 ---\n\n173\nChapter 7Power Of Forgiving Those Who Hurt You Most.”\n• “7 Tips For Becoming Smarter” is clear, but \na bigger PROMISE can help it reach more \npeople. “7 Tips For Becoming Smarter, \nAchieving Chess-Master Memory, And \nBecoming The Most Interesting Person In \nThe Room”\nTo recap:\n• Bigger Questions attract Bigger Audiences\n• Niche Questions attract Niche Audiences\n• Wider Audiences benefit from simple, univer -\nsal language\n• Niche Audiences benefit from ultra-specific, \nniche language\n• Titles that only answer 1 of the 3 questions \nare weak. Titles that answer 2 of the 3 ques -\ntions are good. Titles that answer all 3 of the \nquestions are exceptional\nPieces Of A Perfect Headline\nThe 1  Question  *That Gets* Every Single Millennial  {In \nTrouble}\nThis is a headline from an article I wrote for Inc Magazine  \nthat ended up accumulating over 200,000 views. It ended \nup attracting a lot of attention from other publications, \nsmaller blogs, and even podcasters, all of whom wanted to \nhave a debate about Millennials in the workforce.\n\n--- Page 182 ---\n\n174\nChapter 7To clearly explain what makes a headline great, we need to \nexamine each of the pieces within a headline by itself—so \nyou can see how they fit into the whole. I’ve coded the \nabove headline with different symbols (bold, underline, **, \nitalics, and {}), so we can get into the weeds here and talk \nabout each piece of the sentence.\nThe 1:\nThe first two or three words of a headline are arguably the \nmost important words of the sentence. When people are \nscrolling through titles, they really only look at the begin -\nning and the end. They want to know what this “thing” is \n(the beginning), and what will happen (the end/the PROM -\nISE) if they read it—all in a matter of milliseconds.\nThe beginning of this headline here immediately sets the \ntone: The 1.\nThat’s it.\nThere’s 1 and 1 only.\nThere are two reasons this technique of using a number at \nthe beginning of a headline is so effective. First, it conveys \nconviction, which readers trust. It’s declarative, and any -\nthing that is declarative implies a strong stance or opinion \n(which people love). Second, it sounds short. You’re not \nasking the reader to read about 10 different points, or 100 \ndifferent points. You’re saying, “You just need to know this \n1 thing,” which feels like a very low barrier to entry for a \nreader.\n“Meh, this will only take me a second to read,” they say to \nthemselves, right before they click.\n\n--- Page 183 ---\n\n175\nChapter 7Question\nNext, The 1  has to describe something. The 1… what ?\n• Reason?\n• Way?\n• Solution?\n• Problem?\nThis part of the sentence is the what . It’s the carrot you \ndangle in front of the reader letting them know what  \nthey’re about to read. Without this in the sentence, every \nreader will subconsciously feel like the headline lacks clar -\nity—and when you confuse, you lose.\nThe real key to choosing the right word for this part of the \nheadline is to think about what will stir up the most curios -\nity in your audience.\nThis is the beginning of your Curiosity Gap.\n*That Gets*\nThis is the part of the headline that connects the beginning \nto the end.\nConnecting pieces should be used sparingly. Nobody has \ntime for a 20-word headline, and every additional word \nyou add is one more step the reader needs to slog through \nin order to figure out what the headline is saying, who it’s \nfor, and what they can expect to receive in exchange for \nreading it.\nNow, based on your genre, category, or topic, you might not \neven need these connecting pieces. If you do, make sure to \n\n--- Page 184 ---\n\n176\nChapter 7pick strong, descriptive words. For example, “Gets” is a con -\nversational word, which works well for broader audiences, \nbut truthfully (and this would mean shifting other words \nin the sentence), “Incentivizes” or “Pushes” or “Encourages” \nwould be better words. They’re more descriptive.\nEvery Single Millennial\nThis is the WHO.\nWHO is this article for? Entrepreneurs? Artists? Millen -\nnials? Baby Boomers? And more importantly, within that \ndemographic, WHO specifically? All of them? Some of \nthem? One specific group of them?\nThis is the part of the sentence that caters most to your \ntarget audience. Your WHO doesn’t have to be an age \ndemographic. It could be a group of people joined together \nby an interest or even a place. In a title like “4 Things \nAll Chicagoans Need To Do…,” the WHO is “Chicagoans,” \nwhich also implies a WHERE as well.\nThe two things you need to balance here are:\n• WHO—based on age, ethnicity, location, \ninterest, etc.\n• WHO within that WHO—all of them? Some \nof them? 1% of them?\n\n--- Page 185 ---\n\n177\nChapter 7{In Trouble}\nAnd finally, the ending—also known as THE PROMISE.\nThis is what readers look for most. They want to know \nwhat happens in the story before they even read it.\nThe key to writing a great PROMISE is to use language that \nelicits an emotional response. “Trouble” is a great word \nbecause nobody likes getting into trouble, yet everyone \nloves hearing about other people who get in trouble.\nThe best way to come up with a compelling PROMISE is \nto think deeply about 1) outcomes your readers want to \nreceive, or 2) outcomes your readers want to avoid.\nFor example:\n• “…Become Rich” is a good outcome, but “…\nBecome So Rich You Never Have To Think \nAbout Money Again” is a far more emotional \nand exciting outcome.\n• “…Not Lose Your Job” is a general outcome \nmost people want to avoid, but “…Not Get \nFired On Your First Day” is a more specific, \nmore easily imaginable outcome a lot of \npeople actively worry about.\n• “…Get Married” is a standard outcome, but “…\nGet Married And Stay Together For More Than \n20 Years” is an outcome the reader can measure.\nThe more emotional you can make your PROMISE, the \nmore likely a reader is to want to read, comment, and \nshare your writing.\n\n--- Page 186 ---\n\n178\nChapter 7Because it speaks to a part of their identity.\nProven Headline Formats\nOnce you know how a headline is constructed, you can \nthen start adding and subtracting different puzzle pieces to \nhook your target reader’s attention.\nThere are a handful of headline formats that writers, \nmajor publications, and publishing houses use relent -\nlessly—because they work. It’s the reason why nearly every \nBusiness Insider  or Forbes  article has a similar look and feel, \nand why each genre has its patterns. My recommendation \nfor using these proven formats is to think of ways you can \nincorporate them into your individual style.\nHere are some of the most proven headline formats in \nonline writing:\n• Big Numbers:  For example, “3,000 People \nJust Filed For Unemployment In This Small \nTown In Arkansas. Here’s Why.” This is a \ngreat headline because “3,000 People” is \nconcrete, definitive, easy to imagine, and yet \nan unexpectedly large number—and what’s \nunexpected is exciting.\n• Dollar Signs:  Money is about as universal as \na topic can get. “$400 Million Is How Much \nYou Need To Make In Order To Afford This \nInsane Mansion In Malibu” is eye-catching \nbecause very few people have $400 million. \nDollar signs make the Curiosity Gap wider \nand more interesting for readers.\n\n--- Page 187 ---\n\n179\nChapter 7• Credible Names:  Celebrities, CEOs, pop \nculture icons, anyone the world can easily \nrecognize by name is a great way to hook \nreaders’ attention. “Will Smith’s Advice On \nHow To Live A Fulfilling Life Will Change \nThe Way You See The World Forever” is a \nheadline built on credibility. Yes, there’s a \ngreat PROMISE here, but the real “hook” \ncomes from the fact that it’s advice from Will \nSmith. “Amazon, Apple, Tesla, And 4 Other \nStocks That Have Made Early Investors \nMega-Millionaires” is another example of \nhow to leverage name credibility.\n• “This Just Happened” : Timeliness is a ter -\nrific mechanism for getting readers’ attention \nright now . Words like “Just, Recently, Today, \nNow,” etc., are what tell a reader that of \nall the things on the internet to read, “this \nthing” is high priority. For example, “Michael \nJordan Just Gave A Press Conference And \nNBA Executives Are Furious.” The reason \nyou would want to read that article is to feel \nin-the-know.\n• The Success Story: These headlines sum -\nmarize an amazing event or rare occurrence \nthat doesn’t happen every day. For exam -\nple, “How This Small Team Managed To \nSecure A Six-Figure Investment In Less Than \n1 Week” or “This 1 Group Activity Exercise \nIncreased An Entire Office’s Productivity \nBy 150%.”\n\n--- Page 188 ---\n\n180\nChapter 7• Things That Shouldn’t Go Together: \nCombining two or more things in a headline \nthat don’t typically sit next to each other is a \ngreat way to force readers to pause and take \nan interest. For example, “7 Things KFC And \nMiley Cyrus Have In Common,” or, “What \nJay-Z, Pablo Escobar, And Oprah Can Teach \nUs About Leadership.”\n• For The Industry: These headlines work \nwell when you’re writing for a very specific \naudience. So much so, that you want to call \nthem out right in the title. The more specific \nyou can be about who the piece is for, the \nbetter. For example, “3 Things All Successful \nSmall Business Owners Do To Stay Profit -\nable.”\n• The Topic Within The Topic: Some head -\nlines benefit from a bit of added curiosity. \nThis is a technique that can be applied to \nany of the other headline structures, and \ncan be a great way of making readers feel \nlike they’re getting the “inside scoop.” For \nexample, “7 Ways The Real Estate Indus -\ntry Is Changing (And How You Should Be \nInvesting Your Money).” The first part of the \nheadline is strong, but it’s the second part of \nthe headline (inside parentheses) that gives \nthe first part more context.\n• Question/Answer: These headlines start \nwith a question and end with a hint at the \nanswer. This style is best suited for articles \n\n--- Page 189 ---\n\n181\nChapter 7with a big concept that’s difficult to cram \ninto one headline—but when split in two, \nyou’re able to give more context to the reader, \nfaster. For example, “Can’t Be Productive In \nThe Office? Try Organizing Your Calendar \nLike This” or “Don’t Know How To Track \nYour Goals? This New App Has The Answer.”\n• X Number: 1 Thing, 3 Ways, 5 Lessons, 9 \nHabits, etc. Placing a number at the begin -\nning of a headline tells the reader, “This is all \nyou’re signing up for—just 9 quick habits and \nthen we’re done.” It makes the piece feel like \nthere is a much lower barrier to entry, while \nat the same time setting a concrete expecta -\ntion. The book, “13 Things Mentally Strong \nPeople Don’t Do” became an international \nbestseller using the same headline style that \nhas powered so many articles online.\nAnd of course, you can combine any of these proven \nformats to make your headlines even stronger. For exam -\nple, “The 1 Thing LeBron James Does Every Morning That \nEarns Him An Extra $10 Million Per Year.”\nBuzzFeed has a rule: every writer must write 30 ver -\nsions of a headline  in order to find the right one.\nAll great headlines take time.\nThe first headline you write probably won’t be “it.” There’s \na rewriting process that needs to happen in order to get rid \nof all the tiny words like “if, when, does, it, too, for,” etc., \nthat get in the way of your headline achieving all three \nof its goals: 1) telling the reader what this piece is about, \n\n--- Page 190 ---\n\n182\nChapter 72) whether it’s for them, and 3) whether the PROMISE is \nworth their time.\nThe way I write and rewrite headlines is I first try to say \nwhatever it is I’m trying to say, in as many words as I need \nto say it.\n“The 8 Things You Should Do On A Daily Basis In Order \nTo Become The Best Person You Can Possibly Become, No \nMatter What Obstacles Are In Your Way”\nNext, I think hard about whether or not I’ve really nailed \ndown the PROMISE. Can I PROMISE more? What else does \nthe reader want? What are their emotional wants, needs, \nand desires related to this specific problem or piece of \nadvice?\n“The 8 Things You Should Do On A Daily Basis In Order To \nGet More Done, Achieve Your Goals, And Start Living Your \nBest Life”\nThen, once I feel like I have clarity around the PROMISE, \nI look for words that are still too vague. I want the reader’s \neyes to skim my headline and latch on to two or three words \nthat speak directly to the categories of their interests.\n“The 8 Things You Should Do On A Daily Basis To Be More \nProductive , Achieve Success , And Gain True Financial \nFreedom ”\nFinally, I’ll go through my headline and edit out as many \ntiny connecting words as possible. Less is more.\n“8 Daily Habits That Will Make You More Productive, \nAchieve Success, And Gain True Financial Freedom”\n\n--- Page 191 ---\n\n183\nChapter 7If I get to the end of the exercise and I like the headline \nin its final form, I’ll go and write the piece. And if I went \nthrough the steps and felt like I didn’t end up with some -\nthing powerful enough, I’ll start back at the beginning.\nIf you are a nonfiction writer, then I strongly encourage \nyou to use these techniques in your online writing. Once \nyou learn the formats, you’ll start to see them every -\nwhere—from Medium articles to New York Times  headlines. \nAgain, I’m not advocating for you to sound like you’re \na BuzzFeed  columnist. All I’m doing is pointing out the \ntechniques that work, so you can best decide how to mold \nthem to match your own unique style.\nAnd if you are a fiction writer, then I would encourage you \nto apply these techniques to your story titles, as well as \nyour content marketing. If you want to write a sci-fi book, \nyou should also be writing articles online like, “8 Timeless \nSci-Fi Characters That Defined The Genre Forever.” Because \nchances are, if someone is interested in reading an article \nlike that, they’re also interested in new sci-fi stories like your \nown—which you can subtly mention at the beginning or \nend of the piece.\nPOWER Phrases\nLastly, you always want to be thinking about what \n“POWER phrases” you can add to your headlines to clarify \nthe urgency and importance of whatever it is you’re writ -\ning about.\nFor example, instead of saying “7 Ways…” you could say, “7 \nLittle-Known Ways” or “7 Small But Powerful Ways.” These \ntiny tweaks are what tell readers that what they’re about \n\n--- Page 192 ---\n\n184\nChapter 7to read is different  from all the other articles on the same \ntopic—and can also hint at a more meaningful or impactful \nPROMISE.\nA few examples:\n• 3 Crucial  Lessons About Business You’ll \nLearn Working For A High-Growth Startup \nFounder\n• These Unforgettable  Tips From Silicon \nValley’s 10 Most Successful VC Firms Will \nChange The Way You Think About Business \nForever\n• 9 Memorable  Truths About Life They Don’t \nTeach You In School\n• This 1 Eye-Opening  Takeaway From The \n2019 TED Conference Will Inspire You To Be \nThe Next Success Story In Your Industry\n• 11 Painful  Mistakes Most Founders Make \nRight After Raising Their First Round Of \nFundraising\n• 4 Emerging  Biotech Trends You Should \nKnow Are Quietly Changing The World\n\n--- Page 193 ---\n\n185Chapter  8\nThe Art Of Writing Online: \nHow To Structure The \nPerfect Post\nThere is no “one” correct way to write online.\nEvery day, new writers emerge on the internet that rede -\nfine the rules of the game. That’s what makes the game \nfun, and what keeps creators on their toes.\nHowever, there are absolutely techniques the most popular \nwriters use in order to cater to the consumption habits of \ntoday’s readers. We forget that art is always a reflection \nof society, and writers today are competing in a world \nwhere attention is in short supply. As a result, the writing \nstyles that thrive in today’s environment are ones that \nmove quickly, and respect the reader’s time as much as \nhumanly possible.\nIf you can say it in three sentences instead of five, try to \nsay it in two.\nAnd if you can say it in two sentences, do your very best to \nsay it in one.\n\n--- Page 194 ---\n\n186\nChapter 8Viral articles, Twitter threads, and any other effective piece \nof written content online follows this basic structure:\nSection 1:  Introduction\nSection 2:  X Main Points\nSection 3:  Conclusion\nAs soon as a reader clicks on your headline and says to \nthemselves, “Sure, I’ll bite,” your writing is now racing \nagainst their dwindling attention span. A reader will only \ncontinue reading as long as they have a reason to—and \nevery second that passes is another moment for them to \nquestion, “Why am I still here? Is this worth my time?”\nSo, here’s how you hook them—and keep them hooked \nuntil the end of your piece.\nAs we dig into examples here, I encourage you to skim \nthis chapter and return to it as needed. I’ll be getting very \nin-the-weeds, so please don’t feel the need to make your way \nthrough each example linearly.\nThe Art Of Writing Introductions\nRight away in the introduction, your job is to answer all \nthree of the reader’s preliminary questions:\n1. What is this about?\n2. Is this for me?\n3. What are you PROMISING and how confi -\ndent am I that you’re going to deliver on that \nPROMISE?\n\n--- Page 195 ---\n\n187\nChapter 8The very first sentence is arguably the most important sen -\ntence of the entire piece.\nIt should be a short sentence. It should be a clear sentence. \nIt should be a sentence that a reader can fly through, \ngiving them the feeling they’re off to a running start. You \nare successful if you can nail the entire “point” of the piece \nin ten words or less.\n• “Most people don’t believe me when I say \nI write 10,000 words per day, every day.” \nThis is the first sentence of my viral article, \n“How I Write 10,000 Words Per Day, Every \nDay.”\n• “Success doesn’t happen in an instant.”  \nThis is the first sentence of my viral article,  \n“19 Tiny Habits That Lead To Huge Results.”\n• “There are only 2 ways to become rich.”  \nThis is the first sentence of my viral article, \n“The 1 Habit That Keeps 99% Of People From \nEver Becoming Rich.”\nOnce this sentence has answered the reader’s first ques -\ntion (“What is this about?”), you now have a very limited \namount of time to answer their second and third ques -\ntions—“Is this for me, and what are you PROMISING?”\nThere are a handful of rhythms you can use to answer \nthe remaining two questions and craft an effective \nintroduction.\n\n--- Page 196 ---\n\n188\nChapter 81/3/1\nThe 1/3/1 structure is the best place to start.\nIn 1/3/1, you have one strong opening sentence, three \ndescription sentences, and then one conclusion sentence. \nVisually, this is a powerful way to tell the reader you aren’t \ngoing to make them suffer through big blocks of text, and \nthat you have their best interests in mind.\nHere’s how it works:\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sen -\ntence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of \ncredibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence \nrounds out your argument, guiding the reader toward your \nconclusion.\nThis fifth sentence is your strong conclusion.\nNow, just so you can understand why this technique is so \npowerful, not just from a written perspective but from \na visual perspective, look at those same five sentences all \nclumped together.\nThis first sentence is your opener. This second sentence \nclarifies your opener. This third sentence reinforces the point \nyou’re making with some sort of credibility or amplified \ndescription. And this fourth sentence rounds out your argu -\nment, guiding the reader toward your conclusion. This fifth \nsentence is your strong conclusion.\nIf you clicked on an article and were immediately con -\nfronted with a five-sentence paragraph, you would feel \n\n--- Page 197 ---\n\n189\nChapter 8(viscerally in your body) the weight of what you were \nabout to read.\nThat feeling of weight is what you are always trying to lift \noff your readers’ shoulders.\nEasy reading makes them feel light.\nHere’s an example of the 1/3/1 structure from my \narticle, “How Do Some People Succeed So Quickly? They \nApproach Life Like This.”\nLife is all about perspective.\nThe exact same situation can be perceived in \nvery different ways by two different people. One \nmight see loss — the other, opportunity. One \nmight feel like a victim — the other, a change-\nmaker. Which means, as far as “absolute” \ntruths are concerned, the first step to becoming \nwho you truly want to be in life means accept -\ning the fact that how you see the world might \nnot be the whole picture.\nSo, if our life experience is based upon the way \nwe see the world, then here are some small but \nincredibly impactful mental shifts that can help \nyou see things from a new perspective.\nThe last sentence of the 1/3/1 article should be both \na conclusion and a transition into the next section of the \narticle—your Main Points. This way, the reader feels as \nthough they’ve reached their first “checkpoint” reading \nyour piece (giving them a feeling of accomplishment) while \nalso hinting at where you are going to take them next.\n\n--- Page 198 ---\n\n190\nChapter 8This is what keeps them emotionally connected and \ninvested in reading more.\n1/5/1\nThe 1/5/1 structure is the same as the 1/3/1 structure, just \nwith more room for description and clarification in the \nmiddle.\nHere’s how it works:\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. This \nthird sentence reinforces the point you’re making \nwith some sort of credibility or amplified descrip -\ntion. This fourth sentence builds on that credibility \nor description, giving added context or new infor -\nmation. This fifth sentence explains to the reader \nwhy you’re telling them what you’re telling them. \nAnd this sixth sentence drives home the point.\nThis seventh sentence is your strong conclusion.\nYou want to use the 1/5/1 structure when your opener \nwould benefit from additional context, or you want to tell \na story that requires an extra sentence or two for clarifica -\ntion. However, once you start getting into 1/7/1 or 1/8/1 \nterritory, you’re either trying to tackle too many different \npoints at once, or you are being unnecessarily descriptive. \nThere are cases where having this big of a middle paragraph \ncan work, but I would encourage you to stay away from \nit—and if you do, then your opener sentence and your con -\nclusion sentence should be very short (to counterbalance the \nbig block of text between them).\n\n--- Page 199 ---\n\n191\nChapter 8Here’s an example of the 1/5/1 structure, from my Inc \nMagazine  article, “Being A Freelancer Is Not The Same As \nBeing An Entrepreneur. Here’s Why.”\nThe dream before you take the leap to become a full-time \nentrepreneur is to have “work-life balance.”\nI remember back when I was working my 9-5, a little over \na year ago. I had to commute an hour to work each way, \nwhich made my commitment closer to an 8-6. And then \nsome days I would need to work late, which meant I wouldn’t \nleave until 7, or sometimes 8. I’d finally make it home, throw \nmy backpack onto my bed, and sit in my desk chair with the \nsullen realization that the day was over. I had enough time \nto cook dinner and do a little late-night writing before pass -\ning out and repeating the same dance all over again.\nBecoming an entrepreneur, I thought, would give me more \ntime to enjoy some of my other passions.\nAgain, the purpose of organizing your introductions using \na structure like this is to both verbally and visually tell \nreaders what “type” of writing they’re about to read.\nA 1/3/1 or 1/5/1 opener = easy to read.\nA 7-sentence opening paragraph = difficult to read.\n1/3/2/1 & 1/5/2/1\nThe basic structures of online writing are 1/3/1 and 1/5/1.\nOnce you learn these, you can then start to play with \nrhythm a bit more and elongate your introductions. \nI cannot stress enough how much you do not want  to \n\n--- Page 200 ---\n\n192\nChapter 8elongate your writing by cramming sentence after sentence \ninto one paragraph. Online writing benefits from clearly \nseparated thoughts and statements, which is why I recom -\nmend using variations of the 1/3/1 and 1/5/1 structure if \nyou need the extra space.\nRemember: you want to optimize for speed and Rate of \nRevelation.\nAnything that isn’t absolutely necessary, delete it.\nHere’s how it works:\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. \nThis third sentence reinforces the point you’re \nmaking with some sort of credibility or ampli -\nfied description. And this fourth sentence \nrounds out your argument, guiding the reader \ntoward your conclusion.\nThis fifth sentence is your strong conclusion. \nAnd this sixth sentence is expanding on why \nyou’re making such a strong conclusion.\nThis seventh sentence is what you’re going to \ntalk about next.\nHere, the 1/3/1 structure is being expanded ever so \nslightly into 1/3/2/1, without asking the reader to slog \nthrough too much additional description or explanation. \nAnd with the 1/5/2/1 structure, you’re doing the same \nthing just expanding it a tiny bit more. Notice, we are \nstill keeping one single sentence as the opener, and one \nsingle sentence as the conclusion. This is to visually tell the \n\n--- Page 201 ---\n\n193\nChapter 8reader, “You already read the first sentence, now there’s \njust this one big paragraph and then you can already see \nthe conclusion sentence waiting for you.”\nWhen readers can “see” the end, they’re more likely to \nwant to put in the effort to get there.\n1/ 4/1/1\nWhy the 1/4/1/1 structure works so well is because now \nyour single-sentence conclusion packs two punches instead \nof one.\nHere’s how it works:\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. \nThis third sentence reinforces the point you’re \nmaking with some sort of credibility or ampli -\nfied description. This fourth sentence rounds out \nyour argument. And this fifth sentence speaks to \nthe emotional benefit of the reader.\nThis sixth sentence is your conclusion.\nAnd this seventh sentence is why that conclusion \nmatters so much.\nIf you notice, the only difference between the 1/3/1 struc -\nture and 1/4/1/1 is rhythm.\nOne more sentence doesn’t really change the content of the \nintroduction. But the way the sentences are separated elic -\nits a different response in the reader. The 1/3/1 structure \nfeels strong, but 1/4/1/1 feels stronger, and even more \n\n--- Page 202 ---\n\n194\nChapter 8opinionated—there are two punchlines instead of one. In \nfact, just by moving a single sentence up or down in any of \nthese paragraphs can dramatically change the rhythm of \nyour introduction.\nHere’s an example of the 1/4/1/1 structure from my \narticle,  “6 Important Life Lessons You Can Only Learn \nThrough Failure.”\nNobody learns the hard lessons in life without \nsome element of failure.\nWhen we let someone down, we learn why. \nWhen we fall short of our own expectations, we \nbecome aware of our growth edge. When we \ncrumble under pressure, we become attuned to \nour weaknesses. There is a “lesson” inside each \nand every defeat — and those who ultimately \nreach their goals see these moments as valuable \nopportunities, not punishments.\nUnfortunately, that doesn’t make the learning \nprocess any less painful.\nThere are some lessons in life you just can’t \nlearn without falling down, scraping both knees, \nand getting back up again.\nLike the other structures above, you can elongate your \nintroduction by adding a bit more text in the first major \nparagraph. 1/5/1/1 works, and so does 1/6/1/1. But once \nyou start getting up into 1/7/1/1, you’re asking a bit much \nof your reader—meaning they’re less likely to make it \nthrough your introduction.\n\n--- Page 203 ---\n\n195\nChapter 81/3/1 + 1/3/1\nNow, let’s say you need to write a hefty introduction.\n(I use the word “need” very specifically here, because \nunless there’s a real reason for your introduction to be \nlonger than seven-or-so sentences, you should err on the \nside of brevity and kill a few more of your darlings.)\nA “trick” for making a long introduction seem short is by \nrepeating the first 1/3/1 structure over again, connecting \nthem with a subhead.\nHere’s how it works:\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. \nThis third sentence reinforces the point you’re \nmaking with some sort of credibility or ampli -\nfied description. And this fourth sentence \nrounds out your argument.\nThis fifth sentence is your conclusion.\nNow, here’s a new first sentence as a second opener.\nAnd this second sentence clarifies your second \nopener. This third sentence reinforces the new \npoint you’re making—with some sort of credi -\nbility or amplified description. And this fourth \nsentence rounds out the second point of your \nargument.\nThis fifth sentence is the big conclusion of your \nintroduction.\n\n--- Page 204 ---\n\n196\nChapter 8Now, unless you knew what to look for here, you might \nread a piece structured this way and think, “Well that’s just \na long introduction.” But there’s a lot happening beneath \nthe surface that makes an introduction like this work—  \nspecifically how it moves the reader quickly down the page.\nThe other reason why repeating the 1/3/1 structure works \nso well is because it forces you, the writer, to be conscious \nand clear about what you’re trying to accomplish in each \nsection. Within the first five sentences of the piece, what \nare you trying to say? What’s the one singular point you’re \ntrying to drive home? What’s this story really about? \nAnd then, again in the second 1/3/1 section, what’s the \nnew point you’re looking to drive home? Why is this also \nimportant to the reader? Does it really warrant having its \nown section?\nThinking in “chunks” like this is how you make your writ -\ning more potent.\nAnd readers love writing that doesn’t waste their time.\nHere’s an example of the 1/3/1 + 1/3/1 structure \nfrom my article,  “8 Soft Skills You Need To Work At \nA High-Growth Startup.”\nIt takes a certain type of personality to want to \nwork at a startup — and the crucial qualities of \nstartup employees you decide to hire.\nWhen I was 26 years old, one of my closest \nfriends and I decided we were going to start \na company. He was still in the process of finish -\ning his MBA. I had recently taken the leap from \nmy job as a copywriter working in advertising. \n\n--- Page 205 ---\n\n197\nChapter 8And every few weeks he would fly to Chicago \n(where I was based), or I would fly to Atlanta \n(where he was based), and we’d trade off sleep -\ning on each other’s couches while brainstorming \nwhat our first step was going to be.\nWe called it Digital Press.\nI’ll never forget the day we decided to make our \nfirst hire.\nHe was a freelance writer recommended to me \nby a friend — and we were in the market to \nstart hiring writers and editors (to replace the \njobs my co-founder, Drew, and I were perform -\ning ourselves). We asked him to meet us at Soho \nHouse in Chicago, ordered a bottle of red wine \nto share, and “interviewed” him by the pool on \nthe roof. He was a fiction writer with a passion \nfor fantasy and sci-fi (not business writing, \nwhich was what we needed), and we were young \nand inexperienced just hoping someone would \ntrust us enough to follow our vision.\nWe hired him — and fired him two months later.\nThe last thing I want to point out here is that you can actu -\nally make the 1/3/1 + 1/3/1 structure move even faster \nby combining the last sentence of the first section, and \nthe first sentence of the second section, into one singular \nsubhead.\n\n--- Page 206 ---\n\n198\nChapter 8Here’s how it works:\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. \nThis third sentence reinforces the point you’re \nmaking with some sort of credibility or ampli -\nfied description. And this fourth sentence \nrounds out your argument.\nThis fifth sentence is both your conclusion \nand the first sentence of your second section.\nAnd this sixth sentence clarifies your second \nopener. This seventh sentence reinforces the new \npoint you’re making—with some sort of credibility \nor amplified description. And this eighth sentence \nrounds out the second point of your argument.\nThis ninth sentence is the big conclusion of your \nintroduction.\nVisually, this is so much easier to read. The subhead alone \nchops what could have been a very long introduction into \na bunch of small, digestible bites—and the subhead grabs \nthe reader’s attention in a way that lets them know their \nfirst “milestone” is just a few sentences down. Writers who \ndon’t use subheads are significantly disadvantaged when it \ncomes to writing online, because a reader’s eyes naturally \n“look” for subheads more than they do full paragraphs and \nblocks of text.\nWritten content with no subheads feels exhausting.\nOn the other hand, lists with a lot of subheads feel easy \nand convenient.\n\n--- Page 207 ---\n\n199\nChapter 81/3/1 + Bullets\nOnce you’ve mastered the basics of writing clean, orga -\nnized, and rapid introductions, you can then start to step \nout of the box and use other writing techniques to get \nreaders flying down the page.\nFor example, readers love bulleted lists.\nThis is a technique that works extremely well for your \nMain Points, but there’s also no reason why you can’t use \nit within your introduction as well. A bulleted list is just \na faster, more efficient way to cram a ton of value into \na very short amount of space. The key here isn’t to list \nthings for listing’s sake, but to think about what would \notherwise take five or more sentences to write, and to com -\nmunicate that same information faster in a bulleted list.\nHere’s how it works:\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. This third sen -\ntence reinforces the point you’re making with some sort of \ncredibility or amplified description. And this fourth sentence \nrounds out your argument.\nThis fifth sentence is your conclusion, as well as the subhead \nto your bulleted list.\n• Point #1\n• Point #2\n• Point #3\n• Point #4\n• Etc.\n\n--- Page 208 ---\n\n200\nChapter 8Now, bulleted lists can backfire when not used properly, \nso let me make this very clear. Lists, when combined \nwith sub-par information, come off as weak, boring, and \na waste of time. It’s not the listing of things that readers \nenjoy. What they enjoy is being given a ton of valuable \nand relevant information in a compressed amount of time. \nYour job isn’t to just “list” stuff. It’s to take what otherwise \nwould be a long-winded section and compress it using \na different form or technique.\nHere’s an example of the 1/3/1 + Bullets structure \nfrom my article,  “5 Serious Things You Should Know \nAbout Money Before You Turn 30.”\nMoney, and “financial freedom,” is a skill.\nNo one ever tells you what you should know \nabout money when you’re young. There isn’t \na class in high school, or even college, where \na professor sits you down and says, “Now listen \nup: mastering money is no different than learn -\ning how to shoot a basketball or paint a picture. \nIt just takes practice.”\nInstead, money remains (for many people) this \nmassive unknown in their daily lives.\n• They don’t know how to make more of it.\n• They don’t know how to spend less of it.\n• They don’t know how (they’ll ever) save it.\n• And they don’t know what to do with it once \nthey have it.\nAnd that’s a big problem.\n\n--- Page 209 ---\n\n201\nChapter 81 + Subhead\nAnd finally, if you want to just get straight to the point, \nwhy waste any time?\nOne sentence is all you need in order to frame the piece—\nbefore immediately hitting the reader with the first \nmilestone and subhead.\nHere’s how it works:\nThis first sentence is what the whole piece is \nabout.\nAnd this first subhead is what we’re going to \ndig into right here, right now.\nI don’t recommend this technique for everything you write, \nbut as a way to change things up, it can be a powerful \nmechanism for turning your Rate of Revelation knob to \nlevel 10.\nHere’s an example of the 1 + Subhead structure from \nmy article, “I Used To Have Social Anxiety. These 4 \nMental Shifts Made Me Confident.”\nMost people see confidence as something you’re \nborn with — you either have it or you don’t.\nBut the truth is, confidence is just like any \nother personality trait.\nIf you want to be more patient, you have to \npractice patience. If you want to be more com -\npassionate, you have to practice compassion. If \nyou want to be more thoughtful, you have to \n\n--- Page 210 ---\n\n202\nChapter 8practice doing things intentionally. And if you \nwant to be confident, well then, you simply have \nto practice being confident.\nThe real strategy here is to make the reader feel like \nthey’ve stepped into the middle of a piece by the time \nthey’ve finished reading the very first sentence. There’s \nsomething jarring (in a good way) about seeing the second \nsentence of an article bolded as a subhead. It tells the \nreader, “We’re already getting to the good part,” encourag -\ning them to keep reading.\nT o Recap:\nThe types of introduction structures that work well are:\n• 1/3/1\n• 1/5/1\n• 1/3/2/1\n• 1/5/2/1\n• 1/4/1/1\n• 1/3/1 + 1/3/1\n• 1/3/Subhead/3/1\n• 1/3/1 + Bulleted List\n• 1 + Subhead\nNotice again how every single structure relies on a single \nopening sentence, and always ends with a single con -\nclusion sentence. Pieces that open with two consecutive \nsentences in the first paragraph are weaker. And pieces \nthat open with three or more sentences in the first para -\ngraph are tiring for the reader. As much as possible, you \nwant to crescendo and decrescendo your rhythms, starting \nwith one sentence, then moving up to three, four, or five \n\n--- Page 211 ---\n\n203\nChapter 8sentences, then back down to two sentences, then back \ndown to one—and repeat.\nThis is what makes the reader feel like they’re riding \na wave.\nAnd waves feel good.\nThe Art Of Writing Main Points\nOnce you’ve successfully framed what it is you’re writing \nabout, it’s time to get into the Main Points of the piece.\nYour Main Points are, quite literally, why the reader clicked \non your headline to begin with. In fact, it’s very common \nfor readers to skim (or skip) the introduction of a piece \nand just start reading at the first Main Point. And it’s even \nmore common for readers to not even read the article in its \nentirety. What they’ll do instead is skim the Main Points \nand subheads, and then decide whether it’s worth going \nback and reading the article in full.\nIf the “sweet spot” of an online article is 800 to  \n1 ,200 words, then your job as a writer is to pack as \nmuch value into your Main Points as possible—  \nwithout inflating the piece’s word count.\nOne of the biggest mistakes writers make when structuring \ntheir writing online is not thinking about how much “real \nestate” they’re giving each point.\nWhich is why I encourage you to write backwards.\nOnce you’ve written your introduction (or, even before you \nwrite your introduction), skeleton out your piece by listing \n\n--- Page 212 ---\n\n204\nChapter 8your Main Points. If you are writing an Opinion article, \nyour Main Points are most likely going to be sentences and \nstatements. If you are writing an Actionable Guide, your \nMain Points are going to be either sentences or categories. \nAnd if you are writing a Curated List, your Main Points \nare going to be the things you are listing: habits, lessons, \nmovies, book titles, etc.\nFor example, here are the Main Points of my Opinion \narticle, “Smart People Aren’t Born Smart. They Do This, \nAnd Become Smart As A Result.”\n1. Smart people read (a lot).\n2. Smart people hang around other smart \npeople.\n3. Smart people love making mistakes.\n4. Smart people see value in all types of knowledge.\n5. Smart people work (very, very) hard.\nWhen I started writing this article, the first thing I did \nwas write down these five Main Points. I wanted to have \na sense of direction for the piece, and more importantly, to \nknow how much space I needed to allocate for each point. \nAs a rule of thumb, the more Main Points you have, the \nless explanation you are going to have for each one (in \norder to stay within the sweet spot of 800 to 1,200 words). \nConversely, the less Main Points you have, the more expla -\nnation you are going to need in order for each point to \nstand securely on its own.\nLet me repeat again:\n• More Main Points = Less Explanation\n• Less Main Points = More Explanation\n\n--- Page 213 ---\n\n205\nChapter 8Once you have the skeleton of your piece outlined, and \nyou have a sense of how “big” (visually) each Main Point is \ngoing to be, the next step is to start filling them in.\n1/2/5/3/1\nFor articles that have three or less Main Points, you are \ngoing to want to use a structure that doesn’t cut your \nexplanations too short.\nThe 1/2/5/3/1 structure is a good framework to use when \nthinking about how to make a solid argument for whatever \nit is you’re writing about, without getting “lost in the sauce” \nand rambling on and on.\nHere’s how it works:\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. And \nthis third sentence is why the reader should care.\nThis fourth sentence starts to expand on the \npoint. This fifth sentence is a story, or some sort \nof credible piece of insight. This sixth sentence \nbuilds on that story or insight and tells the \nreader something they maybe didn’t know. This \nseventh sentence is a small conclusion. And this \neighth sentence is why that conclusion matters.\nThis ninth sentence recaps what you just told \nthe reader. This tenth sentence reinforces the \nargument you’re making with an additional \ntidbit or insight. And this eleventh sentence \ndrives the point home.\n\n--- Page 214 ---\n\n206\nChapter 8This twelfth sentence reminds the reader of the \nimportant takeaway.\nLooking at the above, you can then imagine what this \nentire piece would look like if each of your Main Points fol -\nlowed this same structure. Each section opens with a clear, \ndeclarative sentence. Each section ends with a clear declar -\native sentence. And the “bulk” of each section exists in the \nmiddle, where a reader doesn’t feel like they’re slogging \nthrough one long, dense paragraph after another.\nJust so you can get a visual sense, here’s how this structure \nlooks if used within an article with three main points.\nMain Point #1\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. And \nthis third sentence is why the reader should care.\nThis fourth sentence starts to expand on the \npoint. This fifth sentence is a story, or some sort \nof credible piece of insight. This sixth sentence \nbuilds on that story or insight and tells the reader \nsomething they maybe didn’t know. This seventh \nsentence is a small conclusion. And this eighth \nsentence is why that conclusion matters.\nThis ninth sentence recaps what you just told the \nreader. This tenth sentence reinforces the argument \nyou’re making with an additional tidbit or insight. \nAnd this eleventh sentence drives the point home.\nThis twelfth sentence reminds the reader of the \nimportant takeaway.\n\n--- Page 215 ---\n\n207\nChapter 8Main Point #2\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. And \nthis third sentence is why the reader should care.\nThis fourth sentence starts to expand on the \npoint. This fifth sentence is a story, or some sort \nof credible piece of insight. This sixth sentence \nbuilds on that story or insight and tells the \nreader something they maybe didn’t know. This \nseventh sentence is a small conclusion. And this \neighth sentence is why that conclusion matters.\nThis ninth sentence recaps what you just told \nthe reader. This tenth sentence reinforces the \nargument you’re making with an additional \ntidbit or insight. And this eleventh sentence \ndrives the point home.\nThis twelfth sentence reminds the reader of the \nimportant takeaway.\nMain Point #3\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. And \nthis third sentence is why the reader should care.\nThis fourth sentence starts to expand on the \npoint. This fifth sentence is a story, or some sort \nof credible piece of insight. This sixth sentence \nbuilds on that story or insight and tells the \nreader something they maybe didn’t know. This \n\n--- Page 216 ---\n\n208\nChapter 8seventh sentence is a small conclusion. And this \neighth sentence is why that conclusion matters.\nThis ninth sentence recaps what you just told \nthe reader. This tenth sentence reinforces the \nargument you’re making with an additional \ntidbit or insight. And this eleventh sentence \ndrives the point home.\nThis twelfth sentence reminds the reader of the \nimportant takeaway.\nAll of a sudden, whatever you’re writing about feels \nultra-actionable. You know exactly how many Main Points \nyou want to cover. You know exactly how much explaining \nyou should do within each section. And if you want the \npiece to be longer than 800 to 1,200 words, all you have \nto do is keep adding Main Points, copy/pasting the same \nstructure within them.\n1/3/1\nNow, let’s say you’re writing about a topic with more than \nthree points.\nHaving more Main Points does not  mean making the \npiece longer. Your writing, no matter what genre you’re \nin, should not be longer for longer sake—ever. If anything, \nyou want to always be thinking the opposite. You should \nbe asking yourself, “How can I make this shorter? How can \nI make this faster? How can I require less of the reader’s \ntime?”\nSpeed is how you win on the internet.\n\n--- Page 217 ---\n\n209\nChapter 8As I mentioned above, the more Main Points you have in \na piece, the less explanation you should give each point. \nThis is where a structure like 1/3/1 works well—because it \nforces you, the writer, to make serious choices about what’s \nworth saying and what’s not.\nHere’s how it works:\nThis first sentence is your opener.\nThis second sentence clarifies your opener. And \nthis third sentence is why the reader should care. \nThis fourth sentence is your mini conclusion.\nThis fifth sentence is why that mini conclusion \nmatters specifically to your target reader.\nYou can tell there is this massive leap that happens \nbetween the third and fourth sentences. Most writers here \nwould continue describing or explaining whatever it is \nthey’re talking about. Instead, I encourage you to do the \nopposite. Skip right to the end. Tell the reader why this one \nspecific Main Point matters to them, or what their take -\naway should be, and be done. Move on to the next point.\nFor example, here’s the fast-paced 1/3/1 structure exe -\ncuted in my article,  “12 Little Things That Show People \nYou’re Intelligent—Without You Having To Say It.”\n1. Showing up on time.\nThe most simple indicator of all.\nIf you are late, you are disrespectful. It doesn’t \nmatter the circumstance — unless the other \nparty is luckily in the same boat (both of you \n\n--- Page 218 ---\n\n210\nChapter 8enduring the same traffic). But still, it’s always \nbest to be the one on time.\nRule of thumb: if you’re not early, you’re late.\nOn its own, this paragraph might feel like it’s lacking \n“depth.” But what you have to remember is that for pieces \nthat have five or more Main Points, the whole reason why \na reader is there is because they want to know the Main \nPoints themselves—not necessarily a dissertation on each \none. In the above article, I have 12 Main Points. If I had \nexplained each one in depth, chances are, readers would \nhave opened the piece, started scrolling, and then said \nto themselves, “Jesus this is long,” and then gone back to \nwhatever it was they were doing before (probably watching \ncat videos).\nSo instead, I optimized the piece for the Main Points them -\nselves. A reader could skim just the 12 bolded subheads of \nthe piece and still extract “the Main Points.”\nWhich is what happened.\nThat article went viral on Medium and accumulated over \n250,000 views in less than 7 days.\n1/1/1+\nNow, let’s say you want to move the reader along even \nfaster .\nNothing moves a reader along better than a single sentence.\nNothing.\nThis structure is a popular one on the internet, however \n\n--- Page 219 ---\n\n211\nChapter 8it’s also an easy one to abuse. A lot of writers who discover \nthe power of this structure use it exclusively—and their \nwriting ends up feeling over-caffeinated and monotone. \nGreat writing, no matter how fast or slow, benefits from \ndynamics. You want to be staccato, and then you want to \nbe legato. You want to crescendo, and then decrescendo.\nToo much of any one rhythm is boring.\nThe 1/1/1+ structure is a mechanism you should use for \nvery specific sections within your writing: beginnings and \nendings. Single sentences are great for calling out individ -\nual ideas, statements, or descriptions, and doing so several \ntimes in a row can elicit a powerful response in a reader. \nHere’s how it works:\nThis first sentence is a strong statement.\nThis second sentence builds on, reinforces, or \nrepeats that strong statement.\nThis third sentence builds on, reinforces, or \nrepeats that strong statement.\nFor example, I use this structure to emphasize a \nlength of time in my article, “The 1 Thing I Did That \nChanged My Entire Life For The Better.”\nStep 2:\nLike I said, I did this for 2 years.\nTwo. Years.\nNot 3 days.\n\n--- Page 220 ---\n\n212\nChapter 8Not a few weeks.\nTwo entire years. I started to see how the people \nI was surrounding myself with weren’t very \nconducive to who and what I wanted to become. \nI started to realize I was terrific at coming up \nwith ideas but horrible at seeing them through \nto completion. I started to understand why \nI struggled to make friends, and how closed off \nI was from the world.\nIf you notice, immediately following the 1/1/1/1 structure, \nI went into a lengthier paragraph. This was deliberate. \nWhen you use the 1/1/1+ structure, you are building \nmomentum. You are moving a reader quickly from Point A \nto Point B. But after a few big steps, the reader is not going \nto want to run anymore. They’re going to want to take a \nquick break and settle into the thing you’re talking about. \nSo, crescendo with the 1/1/1+ rhythm, and then decre -\nscendo with a three, four, or even five-sentence paragraph.\nThen repeat.\nMain Point / 1, 2, or 3\nFinally, let’s say you are writing a piece with twenty Main \nPoints.\nAgain, unless you are intentionally trying to write a mas -\nsive Ultimate Guide that requires twenty Main Points and \nin-depth explanations for all of them, you are going to \nwant to optimize your writing for readers who are there to \nskim. That said, I can’t stress enough how important it is \nfor the writing beneath each Main Point to still hold value. \nJust because you only have two sentences to make a point, \n\n--- Page 221 ---\n\n213\nChapter 8doesn’t mean those two sentences are worthless. If any -\nthing, you should be asking how you can make those two \nsentences as impactful as possible—with the understand -\ning that some readers are only going to read your bolded \nMain Points.\nHere’s how it works:\nYou have your Main Point here.\nAnd then you have one, two, or three sentences \n(max) expanding on that Main Point.\nThat’s it.\nBecause you have to think: if you are aiming to write \na 1,000 word article, and you have twenty Main Points, \nthat means each point can only have 50 words—and that’s \nnot counting your introduction, or any sort of conclusion.\nWhich is why I encourage you to skeleton your pieces and \nlist out your Main Points before you begin.\nFor example, I use this structure in my article,  \n“20 Things Nobody Tells You About Growing Up.”\n1. Most people are scared of imagination\nThey’ve disconnected with their inner child. \nThey don’t feel they are “creative.” They like \nthings “just the way they are.”\n2. Your dream doesn’t really matter to \nanyone else.\nSome people might take interest. Some may \nsupport you in your quest. But at the end of the \n\n--- Page 222 ---\n\n214\nChapter 8day, nobody cares, or will ever care about your \ndream as much as you.\n3. Friends are relative to where you are in \nyour life.\nMost friends only stay for a period of time — \nusually in reference to your current interest. But \nwhen you move on, or your priorities change, so \ntoo do the majority of your friends.\nIn articles like these, it’s the Main Points that are the most \nvaluable parts of the entire piece.\nRemember, the reason why a reader chose to click on this \nheadline was because they cared about the “20 Things.” \nSo, I spent a significant amount of time refining each \nMain Point to be highly relevant to the reader and topic \nat hand. If my Main Points had been broad, vague words \ninstead, I guarantee this article wouldn’t have performed as \nwell as it did (300,000 views across Inc Magazine , Quora, \nand Medium).\nTake a look:\n1. Imagination\nThey’ve disconnected with their inner child. They don’t \nfeel they are “creative.” They like things “just the way \nthey are.”\n2. Dream\nSome people might take interest. Some may support you \nin your quest. But at the end of the day, nobody cares, \nor will ever care about your dream as much as you.\n\n--- Page 223 ---\n\n215\nChapter 83. Friends\nMost friends only stay for a period of time — usu -\nally in reference to your current interest. But when \nyou move on, or your priorities change, so too do the \nmajority of your friends.\nA style like this (where the subheads are just individual \nwords) is actually much harder for a reader to skim.\nThe reason is because the Main Points don’t really give \n“the answer” they came looking for (“What are the 20 \nThings?”). Instead, they’re forced to take an extra step \nand actually read each point in detail. And I can hear a lot \nof crusty old writers shouting, “Yes! God forbid a reader \nactually reads the damn thing!” But as the young whipper -\nsnapper in the room here, I have to be the bearer of bad \nnews and point out: how you get readers online to actually  \nread what you wrote in the first place is by hooking their \nattention.\nOtherwise, they aren’t even going to get past your first \nMain Point.\nBolded Statements\nNow, let’s say you aren’t writing something that is a num -\nbered list.\nAll of these same mechanics, structures, and rhythms still \napply. Instead of thinking of your Main Points in terms of a \nlist, think of them in terms of individual statements. What’s \nthe next “new” piece of information you can reveal to the \nreader? And how can you emphasize certain statements, \ninsights, or stories to drive home the purpose of the piece?\n\n--- Page 224 ---\n\n216\nChapter 8Writers severely  underestimate how powerful subheads are \nin the world of online writing. If you don’t use subheads, \nyou’re at a disadvantage simply because readers on the \ninternet specifically look for bolded, highlighted, empha -\nsized pieces of the story. Why? Because these feel like \nshortcuts. They’re candy. A bolded sentence subconsciously \ntells a reader, “I’m not going to waste your time. Some -\nthing important is happening here.”\nWhen executed perfectly, the same way a reader could skim \nall the Main Points of an article and feel like they “got it,” \na reader should be able to skim all the bolded subheads and \nsentences within a piece and feel like they “got it.”\nFor example, here’s an introduction that uses sub -\nheads to push a reader along quickly, in my article, \n“How I Spend My Free Time Is Why I Am Successful.”\nInvest in yourself.\nThe other day, I was chatting with a friend of \na friend, a senior in high school who was getting \nready to go off to college.\n“I want to start my life over,” he said. “I want to \nreinvent myself, and prove that you don’t have \nto follow the same path as everyone else.”\n“You can do that,” I said. “But you have to be \nwilling to do 1 thing that not very many teenag -\ners and young adults are willing to do.”\n“What’s that?” he asked.\nYou have to spend more time learning \noutside of class, than you do in class.\n\n--- Page 225 ---\n\n217\nChapter 8This goes for anyone in school, out of school, \nyoung, old, whatever. You’re either in class, or \nyou’re at work.\nDuring those hours, you can learn. You can \ngrow. You can improve certain skills. You can \neven make money.\nBut anyone who truly makes something of them -\nselves sees that time as their daily standard. But \nthey do not see it as “the end.” They do not get \nout of class, or leave work and think, “Ah, time \nto sit back, relax, and just chill.”\nNo. They take that “free time” and they \nreinvest it in themselves.\nThey work on a side project.\nThey practice their craft.\nThey improve their skills, or study, or spend time \nlearning from people far more knowledgeable.\nHad I not bolded these sentences, this piece would have \nbeen read completely differently. In fact, it’s the way these \nsentences are separated out and highlighted that gives \nthem so much power. Had I just buried them within a \nparagraph, they would have lost a lot of their weight.\nTake a look:\nThe other day, I was chatting with a friend of a \nfriend, a senior in high school who was getting \nready to go off to college. “I want to start my life \nover,” he said. “I want to reinvent myself, and \n\n--- Page 226 ---\n\n218\nChapter 8prove that you don’t have to follow the same \npath as everyone else.”\n“You can do that,” I said. “But you have to be \nwilling to do 1 thing that not very many teenag -\ners and young adults are willing to do.”\n“What’s that?” he asked.\nYou have to spend more time learning outside of \nclass, than you do in class. This goes for anyone \nin school, out of school, young, old, whatever. \nYou’re either in class, or you’re at work. During \nthose hours, you can learn. You can grow. You \ncan improve certain skills. You can even make \nmoney. But anyone who truly makes something \nof themselves sees that time as their daily stan -\ndard. But they do not see it as “the end.” They \ndo not get out of class, or leave work and think, \n“Ah, time to sit back, relax, and just chill.”\nThe content is exactly the same, but because it’s structured \ndifferently, you read it differently.\nWhich is why there is so much power in understanding the \nvisual nature of online writing, and how you can use these \nsignals to your advantage—to hook and keep a reader’s \nattention.\nOnce you understand the basics of creating a skeleton \nof your Main Points, and expanding or contracting the \namount of explanation for each, you can then start to \nmake up your own structures and rhythms.\nHere are a few more that I use often.\n\n--- Page 227 ---\n\n219\nChapter 8Short / Long / Long / Short\nThinking of structure in terms of sentence length is only \nthe beginning. You have a lot more room to play in if you \nthink of total paragraph length instead.\nFor example, here’s an excerpt from my article,  \n“Disciplined People Who Achieve Their Goals Live By These \n7 Habits.”\nAnyone can make a list of goals—but only a few \nlearn how to be disciplined enough to achieve \nthem.\nI grew up in a home and a family that \nconstantly reinforced the importance of self-dis -\ncipline. Every single night, I’d watch my dad \nset the timer on the coffee maker and put his \noatmeal in the refrigerator for the next morning. \nBy 5:30 a.m., he’d be awake. By 6:00 a.m., he’d \nbe in the gym. By 7:00 a.m., he’d be knocking \non my bedroom door, making sure I was awake. \nAnd by 8:00 a.m., he’d be at the hospital ready \nto operate. My dad is a spine surgeon.\nMy mom, meanwhile, somehow managed to \nwork as a voice teacher at a local college, and \ntake my sister to her violin lessons, and take \nmy younger brother to gymnastics practice, and \ntake my other younger brother to chess club, all \nwhile making sure dinner was on the table by \n5:00 p.m., and everyone was working on their \nhomework or practicing their respective musical \ninstrument by 7:00 p.m.\n\n--- Page 228 ---\n\n220\nChapter 8Our house operated like a retreat for the arts \nwith my mother’s thumb on a stopwatch.\nParagraphs two and three in this excerpt are nearly the \nsame size—and yet the second paragraph is six sentences \nand paragraph three is one very long sentence.\nThere are a few things to take note of here.\nFirst,  you never want to have three or more long para -\ngraphs one after another. That style of writing has been \ndead for years, and anyone writing that way on the inter -\nnet is clinging to a way things were but no longer are.\nSecond,  if you are going to have long paragraphs one after \nanother, you want to find ways to change up their internal \nrhythm so they don’t feel or sound exactly the same. One \nway of doing this is by using punctuation. Have one para -\ngraph with a lot of short, strong sentences. Have the next \nparagraph be one long, winding sentence.\nThis is what makes them seem “different.”\nLastly,  notice how before and after both long paragraphs \nin the above excerpt there are single, declarative sentences. \nThis is very intentional. Again, you want to subtly tell the \nreader, “I’m going to tell you a quick story—this will only \ntake a second,” before giving them their next mile marker. \nThere’s something about reading a single sentence after a \nlong paragraph that gives a reader the same feeling a lis -\ntener gets hearing a chord resolve on the piano.\nLet your chords resolve.\n\n--- Page 229 ---\n\n221\nChapter 8Repetition\nRepetition is a common mechanism in poetry.\nBut that doesn’t mean it can’t be used in other forms of \nwriting.\nOne of the best ways to avoid spending unnecessary time \nexplaining things to a reader is to use repetition as a way \nof advancing your Rate of Revelation. Think of repetition \nas a bulleted list, but in prose form.\nFor example, here’s an excerpt from my article,  “How \nDo Some People Succeed So Quickly? They Approach Life \nLike This.”\n1. Every single moment, of every single day, \nyou are “practicing” something.\nIf you don’t floss in the morning, you’re practic -\ning not-flossing.\nIf you choose to eat quinoa and veggies instead \nof Frosted Flakes, you’re practicing eating for \nfuel instead of eating for enjoyment.\nIf you yell at your significant other, you’re prac -\nticing a lack of self-control.\nIf you watch TV instead of working on your \nbook, you’re practicing postponing your dream \nof becoming a novelist.\nThe moment you start to see the world this way, \nyou start to realize that every single moment, of \nevery single day, you are practicing something. \n\n--- Page 230 ---\n\n222\nChapter 8And how aware you are of whatever it is you’re \npracticing dictates how consciously (or uncon -\nsciously) you move toward or away from where it \nis you actually want to be: whether that’s a des-\ntination, a physical place, or an emotional state.\nHere, I am combining the 1/1/1/1 structure with repeti -\ntion to give a reader plenty of actionable examples without \nforcing them to read through paragraphs of prose. I’m only \ngiving them what they absolutely need—and then once \nI’ve given them a handful of examples, I follow up with \na longer, more descriptive paragraph (alternating rhythms).\nFirst, Second, etc.\nThere’s a subtle difference in voice between an article that \n“lists” two points, compared to one that emphasizes point \none, and then point two. Now, will numbering vs “saying” \nyour points make or break the performance of your piece? \nProbably not. But these small details are the types of things \nyou should be constantly questioning in your writing.\nFor example, here’s an excerpt from my article, “You \nStop Being Productive The Moment You Do This.”\nContrary to popular belief, there is such a thing \nas being “too productive.”\nI like to think about this in two ways:\nFirst, you are being “too productive” the \nmoment that your input becomes dispro -\nportionate to your output.\nLet’s use writing as an example.\n\n--- Page 231 ---\n\n223\nChapter 8I know a good many writers who feel all sorts of \nproductive simply because of how many books \nthey’re able to read in a day, week, month, \nor year.\nNow, let’s say you are an incredibly productive \nreader. You are able to read pages and pages \nwithout effort. You are able to retain a sig -\nnificant amount of the material you consume. \nWhen it comes to reading, you are an absolute \nprofessional.\nThe problem is, your “Chief Aim,” your GOAL, \nisn’t to become a master reader (maybe that’s \na tangential goal, but it’s not your main goal). \nYour goal is to become a writer. And while \nreading is certainly an important part of \nwriting, and become a professional writer, the \nmoment your input becomes disproportionate \nto your output, you are no longer being pro -\nductive. Because while you may be turning into \nan incredibly effective reader, there is a tipping \npoint where “more reading” isn’t going to move \nyou any further along as a writer.\nSo, the “act” can be productive, but unless the \n“act” is aligned with the GOAL, then it wouldn’t \nbe accurate to say your ACTIONS (as a whole) \nare productive.\nThat’s the first example.\nThe second example of being “too productive” \nis when your productivity has a dispropor -\ntionate impact on your quality of life.\n\n--- Page 232 ---\n\n224\nChapter 8In order to achieve anything great in life, you \nwill have to make sacrifices.\nIt would be naive to think that you could \nachieve the highest levels of success (or “produc -\ntivity”) without some compromise: letting go \nof certain relationships, eating less healthfully, \nsleeping less, enduring high amounts of stress, \netc. Whatever that compromise becomes is up \nto you, but somewhere, somehow, your drive \ntoward your “Chief Aim” will cause you to have \nto ignore other aspects of your life.\nHowever, there’s a tipping point here as well.\nThe moment your drive puts you in the hospi -\ntal, you know you have a problem. The moment \nyour significant other sits you down and says, \n“I can’t keep seeing you like this,” you know \nyou’ve gone too far. The variables of life can \nbend, but at a certain point, they can and they \nwill snap. And it’s up to you to figure out how \nfar you can bend before you break.\nBy crafting each Main Point as a statement, instead of just \na two-point list, the piece feels like you’re speaking directly \nto the reader. They can hear the emphasis in the voice. \nThey can feel the power of what’s being said, and under -\nstand why these two (specific) Main Points are delivering \non the PROMISE made in the headline.\nThere’s also an element of repetition here, writing out \n“first” and “second” in the subheads. There was also rep -\n\n--- Page 233 ---\n\n225\nChapter 8etition in the very first example I used, each subhead \nstating, “Smart People X, Smart People Y, Smart People Z.” \nThere’s something about repetition in subheads that tells \nthe reader, “This piece was very intentionally organized,” \nagain reinforcing that you are credible, that you know \nwhat you’re doing, and that you’re the right person they \nshould be reading on this particular topic.\nLook at the way I’ve structured this chapter:\n• The Art Of Writing Introductions\n• The Art Of Writing Main Points\n• The Art Of Writing Conclusions\nRepetition.\nBold ½ Sentences\nThis is one of my favorite, and yet one of the least used \nmechanisms in online writing.\nCombine repetition with bolding the first half of your sen -\ntences.\nThe whole idea here is to do nothing but emphasize the \nstructure you’re using to your readers. So much of online \nwriting is about signaling—signaling this piece is easy \nto read, signaling you know what you’re doing, signaling \nit’s fun and there’s a voice and rhythm here worth paying \nattention to (see how even in this sentence, I’ve repeated \nthe word “signaling” multiple times?).\n\n--- Page 234 ---\n\n226\nChapter 8For example, here’s an excerpt from my article,  \n“This 1 Tip Changed My Writing Forever.”\nA few months after that, he’d quit the game \nand I was one of the highest-ranked play -\ners in the entire country.\nThat lesson is, to date, one of the most influ -\nential pieces of advice I’ve ever received as \na human being. That was the first time someone \nI looked up to, someone I wanted to “be like,” \ntold me that no amount of me watching or idol -\nizing someone else was going to replace the hard \nwork I needed to put in myself.\nWhen I started my gaming blog as a teenager,  \nI implemented that same mentality. I didn’t \nreally read anyone else’s blog. I didn’t “consume.” \nI just wrote. And wrote. And wrote. Every single \nnight before bed, I pushed myself to write 1 new \nblog post for the following morning. And by the \ntime I showed up for my first journalism class, \nFreshman year of college, I had 10,000 gamers \nreading my blog every single day — an unheard \nof accomplishment in 2009, back when blogging \nwas considered “weird.”\nWhen I quit gaming and started bodybuild -\ning, I applied this same mentality again. I didn’t \nspend hours and hours watching other people \nlift online. I went to the gym and lifted myself. \nAnd I transformed from a 110 pound, awkward, \nskinny teenager, to a 170 pound shredded fit -\nness model.\n\n--- Page 235 ---\n\n227\nChapter 8When I stopped bodybuilding and started \nreally nurturing my craft for writing,  I did \nit again. I wrote 1 answer every single day here \non Quora for almost 3 years in a row. I wrote \n400+ columns for Inc Magazine. I ghostwrote \nnearly 1,000 articles for CEOs and founders and \ninvestors and public speakers. And every single \nnight, I worked on my first book, Confessions of \na Teenage Gamer. I didn’t sit in my room and \nconsume other people’s writing for hours and \nhours. I practiced my writing instead.\nIn this story, each one of these paragraphs is covering \na different period of time.\nIf I had crammed them all together, the reader would have \nfelt overwhelmed, and maybe even lost. They’d have said \nto themselves, “Wait, what do gaming and bodybuilding \nand writing have to do with each other? Why are you \njumping around so much?”\nTo combat that confusion, I chose to separate each “chap -\nter,” and then bold the first half of the sentence to signal to \nthe reader, “In this paragraph we’re talking about gaming. \nIn this paragraph we’re talking about bodybuilding. And \nin this paragraph we’re talking about writing.” All of \na sudden, this small tweak makes the reader feel like they \nhave a firm sense of what they’re reading and how it’s \nbeing organized.\nThe key, however, is to tie the bolded sentence to one para -\ngraph and one paragraph only.\nA less effective way of using this mechanism would look \nlike this.\n\n--- Page 236 ---\n\n228\nChapter 8When I started my gaming blog as a teenager, \nI implemented that same mentality. I didn’t \nreally read anyone else’s blog. I didn’t “consume.” \nI just wrote.\nAnd wrote.

I didn’t sit in \n\n--- Page 237 ---\n\n229\nChapter 8my room and consume other people’s writing for \nhours and hours. I practiced my writing instead.\nBy separating the paragraphs out, the general concept still \n“works,” it’s just not nearly as effective.\nThe strategy behind bolding the first half of a sentence is \nto signal to the reader, “This sentence, and this entire para -\ngraph , are one section.”\nThe Art Of Writing Conclusions\nConclusions are tricky.\nIn stories, particularly fiction but also nonfiction as well, \nthe conclusion of the story is known as the “descending \naction.” The climax has already happened—the wall was \ntorn down, the war was officially won (or lost), the main \ncharacter’s love interest died, etc.—and now the reader \nneeds to know how things ended up. What was the result \nof this story’s climax?\nInherently, any descending action is going to be less \ninteresting than the ascending action that came before it. \nThere’s momentum, anticipation, and suspense in ascend -\ning action. Descending action is more about reflection and \nmeaningful takeaways. And these can still be interesting \nstory elements to the reader, but there’s a reason why the \nascending action was 200 pages and the descending action \nwas the last 30 pages of the book.\nOnce the climax happens, the reader is “done.”\n\n--- Page 238 ---\n\n230\nChapter 8When it comes to online writing, \nconclusions are optional.\nThe truth is, readers don’t need them.\nEspecially in an 800 to 1,200-word article, a conclu -\nsion should happen in the span of a paragraph—or even \na single sentence. Your last Main Point is technically the \n“climax” of the piece. And if we know anything about digi -\ntal readers, it’s that as soon as they’re “done,” they’re done. \nThey’ve already swiped back to their feed and started \nlooking for the next piece of content to give their time \nand attention.\nHere are a handful of rhythms you can use to craft effec -\ntive conclusions.\nThe Cliff\nOne of the best ways to get a reader to read another piece \nof your writing is to leave them with a massive cliffhanger.\nThis type of structure works well with Curated Lists, where \nthe entire purpose of the piece is for you to list Main Points \nthat speak to the reader’s interests. In these types of pieces, \nthe reader doesn’t need a big, fancy conclusion. They got \nwhat they came for and they’re happy you delivered on \nthat PROMISE.\nSo, as soon as you finish your last Main Point, jump off the \ncliff.\nDon’t even say goodbye.\n\n--- Page 239 ---\n\n231\nChapter 8For example, here’s the last Main Point from my arti -\ncle, “30 Things You Should Know About Life Before You \nTurn 30.”\n30. Ten years is a very long time.\nWhen I was 19, 20 years old, I wanted to be \na rapper.\nWhen I was 21, 22, 23, I wanted to be a body -\nbuilder.\nWhen I was 24, 25, 26, I wanted to be a creative \ndirector at a huge advertising agency.\nWhen I was 27, 28, 29, I wanted to be an entre -\npreneur.\nAnd from age 17 to 29, I’ve wanted to be \na writer.\nIn my 20s, I got to live 4 completely different \nlives. I immersed myself in 4 different industries, \nlearned entire tool kits of different skills, made \ndifferent friends, explored different paths, and \nultimately became different versions of myself.\nAnd every one of those pursuits made me who \nI am “today.”\nIf I was able to live that many different lives in \nthose ten years, then I can only imagine what \n30 to 40 will look like, and how many different \nlives I may be able to live again.\nTen years is a long time. And the older you get, \n\n--- Page 240 ---\n\n232\nChapter 8the more knowledge you accumulate, the more \nresources you have, and the more freedom in \nfront of you to become whatever it is you want \nto become.\nI don’t feel old at 30.\nI feel like I’m just getting started.\nHere, I deliberately wrote the last Main Point of the piece \nto stick within the structure of all the other Main Points, \nbut also “sound” like a conclusion. There’s no all-  \nencompassing takeaway. There’s no whole other section \nexplaining to the reader why what they just read matters. \nMy PROMISE was, “30 Things You Should Know About Life \nBefore You Turn 30.” I delivered on that PROMISE.  \nAnd now we’re done.\nHowever, even if your last Main Point doesn’t have \na nuanced conclusion, this technique can still work well.\nFor example, here’s how I end my article, “Successful \nPeople Tell Themselves These 7 Things On A Daily Basis.”\n7. “Never forget why you started.”\nAgain, I am constantly surprised by people who \nhave achieved massive amounts of success in \ntheir lives, and how connected they are to the \nbeginning of their journey.\nThey remember where they started. They remind \nthemselves often why they got into the business \nthey’re in. Their motivation comes from a love \nfor growth, not necessarily the achievement of \nan end goal.\n\n--- Page 241 ---\n\n233\nChapter 8In order to maintain long-term success, this \nis a crucial part of the process. You have to \nremember why you started down this road in \nthe first place — and do everything in your \npower to make sure you never forget it.\nAs a reader, if you finished reading this article and felt \nyourself wanting more, you would need to click to read \nanother one of my articles.\nThat’s the whole point of The Cliff.\nThe Extended Final Main Point\nAnother way you can end a piece is by baking your mini \nconclusion into the very last Main Point.\nInstead of starting a whole new section, just extend your \nfinal thoughts with an extra paragraph or sentence. Elab -\norate not just on the Main Point you were making, but on \nthe meaningful takeaways from all your Main Points in the \npiece.\nFor example, I use the Extended Final Main Point \nstructure in this article, “7 Questions You Should Ask \nYourself To Become A Better Person.”\n7. “How can I be more helpful — to those \naround me, and to myself?”\nIt’s taken me a long time to learn that if you \ncan’t spend all your time trying to make every -\none around you happy.\nYou have to prioritize keeping yourself happy too.\n\n--- Page 242 ---\n\n234\nChapter 8Which is why it’s worth questioning both, simul -\ntaneously.\nWhat can you do to be more helpful to those \naround you? How can you be more encouraging, \nmore patient? And at the same time, how can \nyou do those same things toward yourself?\nPersonal development is an ongoing practice. \nIt’s not a destination. It’s not something you do \nonce and then you’re a “perfect person” for the \nrest of your life.\nPersonal development is your ability to contin -\nuously ask yourself these questions on a daily \nbasis, and slowly improve over time.\nLike water over rocks, who you are is sculpted \nover years and years.\nIf you read closely, the final Main Point ends and the con -\nclusion begins with the sentence, “Personal development is \nan ongoing practice.”\nAs a reader, there’s no clear indicator they’ve exited the last \nMain Point and suddenly entered the conclusion—which \nis good. The reader then gets the benefit of feeling  like the \npiece has a nice neat bow on top, without needing to slog \nthrough a whole other section repeating everything that \ncame before it (which most readers will just skim through \nanyway).\n\n--- Page 243 ---\n\n235\nChapter 8The Summary\nThe Summary technique works particularly well within \nActionable Guide articles, or very long pieces with lots of \ndifferent sections.\nReaders appreciate summaries. There’s a reason why every \nself-help or business book ends each chapter with a “recap” \nor page of “action steps.” Especially when you’re covering a \nlot of ground, or a topic requires a lot of additional expla -\nnation, summaries are a way for you to make sure you and \nthe reader are on the same page (pun intended) before \nmoving on to the next Main Point.\nFor example, I use a bulleted summary as the con -\nclusion of my article, “You Stop Being Productive The \nMoment You Start Doing This.”\nThe art of “being productive,” then, is all \nabout balancing the following variables:\n• Input as it relates to output (you should be \n“doing” more than you’re “consuming”)\n• Productivity weighed against the sustainable \naspects of your life (mental, physical, emo -\ntional, and spiritual health)\n• Driving the highest impact for the lowest \namount of effort (prioritizing what’s truly \ngoing to “move the needle” over what doesn’t \nmove the needle but feels urgent)\nFinding this sweet spot is the reason why some \npeople do incredible things with our universal \n\n--- Page 244 ---\n\n236\nChapter 824-hour clock, and others do almost nothing.\nInstead of re-stating everything I had said earlier in the \npiece, I recapped the Main Points in a bulleted list to make \nthe reader feel like they had the Sparknotes version—with \none single sentence at the very end as an all-encompassing \nconclusion. You can also imagine how you could use this \ntechnique at the end of an introduction, or even at the end \nof any of your Main Points to help the reader follow along \nmore closely.\nReaders love checklists, action steps, quick recaps, small \nreminders, etc., so the more you can use these techniques \nto your advantage, the easier it will be for them to under -\nstand precisely what it is you’re trying to tell them.\nStrong Opinion\nIf you’re going to take the time to end a piece with some \nsort of complete conclusion, I encourage you to make it \na Strong Opinion.\nThere’s nothing more boring to a reader than writing that \nre-says what it just said. A great conclusion is one that \ndrives home a new point, or makes it very clear why some -\none should or shouldn’t do something. Actionable advice, or \nan unexpected insight, are things that make the reader feel \nlike the conclusion is another Main Point, just speaking a \nbit more holistically.\nFor example, this is the conclusion in my Opinion arti -\ncle, “Why Gary Vaynerchuk’s Perspective On Meditation \nIs Everything That’s Wrong With Mindfulness In Entrepre -\nneurship.”\n\n--- Page 245 ---\n\n237\nChapter 8Stop trying to ‘unlock’ yourself for the sake \nof achievement.\nAs Vaynerchuk says often, “I don’t know what \nwill happen once I buy the Jets. I don’t actually \nwant to buy the Jets. I’m in love with the hustle. \nThe Game.”\nAnd what happens when that game stops? When \nyou can no longer escape into the endlessly \nfun pursuit of mastering the rules, overcoming \nobstacles, and proving yourself among your \ncompetitors? What happens when you’ve bought \nthe new “meditation drink” and you’re bored of \nwearing your “meditation clothes” and you’ve \neaten at all the nearby “meditation-friendly \nfood spots.”\nThe dust will settle. You will find yourself in \nsilence.\nAnd in that uncomfortable moment, with noth -\ning else to achieve, you will be left with only \nyourself.\nTHAT, is the purpose of meditation. And \nI encourage every — not just entrepreneur, but \nhuman being — to make time for that practice.\nWhat makes this an effective conclusion is that the advice, \n“Stop trying to ‘unlock’ yourself for the sake of achieve -\nment” could be a Main Point in itself.\nThis is why I’m such a big believer in The Cliff as a writ -\ning mechanism for the internet. Everything you write \nshould, in some sense, feel like both a stand-alone piece \n\n--- Page 246 ---\n\n238\nChapter 8and a piece within your larger library. You want  readers \nto want more from you. You want  them to feel like you cut \nthem off right when momentum was high. You want  them \nclicking to read more and more and more of your stuff—\nwithout them feeling tricked or dragged along.\nLazy writers do this by saying things like, “Which is why, if \nyou want to know more, you should check out my website, \nand if you want to hear what I really think about this topic, \nyou should check out my YouTube,” blah blah blah.\nReaders hate that shit.\nInstead, just say what you want to say in this one individ -\nual piece, and be done. Let there be some dissonance in \nthe air. Let readers feel like you could have said more, but \ndidn’t.\nThis is what gets them to come back again and again.\nLanguage Rules\nThe last thing I want to touch on here is about language.\nAll of these structures and rhythms I’ve outlined for you \nwill be read in very different ways depending on the type \nof language you choose within your writing. For example, \n“Dareth I say thou art but a reader of mine?” is a completely \ndifferent language set than, “Do you want to read some -\nthing I wrote?”\nAs a rule of thumb: readers on the internet don’t like com -\nplicated.\nSure, you can make the argument that you’re a professor or \n\n--- Page 247 ---\n\n239\nChapter 8a scientist and readers within your niche care very much \nabout density of language, but even still, I would remind \nyou of the context in which they are reading. There’s a mas -\nsive cognitive difference between scrolling through status \nupdates in your Facebook feed versus reading an in-depth \nanalysis on the future of blockchain technology. And since \nmost readers use these candy-like social environments to \ndiscover new pieces of writing online, they are going to feel \nthe mental difference between reading, “Oh my God, if I \nhear about the Kardashians I’m going to lose my mind” and \n“Zk-SNARKs are trustless zero-knowledge proof systems.”\nI’m not advocating for dumbing your writing down.\nI’m advocating for making deliberate choices to make your \nwriting sound more natural.\nHere are a few writing rules I encourage you to live by:\n• Write for the everyday person.  If you are \nhell-bent on writing at an academic level, \nrealize you are writing for a considerably \nsmaller audience—which means, by defini -\ntion, your material will almost never be read \nby the masses. If what you want is broad \nexposure, then it’s important for you to use \nnon-complicated language. For example, \ndon’t use semicolons (very few people under -\nstand how they work anyway). If there’s \na simpler synonym for a word less than 10% \nof society knows the definition to, use it. \n(Why? Because most people don’t use words \nlike, “prodigious” or “confounding” when \nthey speak. They just say, “Wow that was \namazing.”)\n\n--- Page 248 ---\n\n240\nChapter 8• Write how you speak.  Record yourself \ntalking about a topic and then transcribe \nthe recording. Pay close attention to the \nrhythm of your natural sentences, versus \nthe rhythms you try to use when writing to \n“sound” more professional in your writing. As \na rule of thumb, anyone who tries to sound \nprofessional ends up sounding inauthentic, \nand those who lean into their authentic voice \nend up being perceived as the most relatable.\n• Avoid long sentences.  Unless you’re using \none long sentence stylistically, like to \ncounterbalance a paragraph of many short \nsentences, you should err on the side of brev -\nity. The more winding your thoughts, the \nmore confusing your writing will be for the \nreader to follow. Remember, you are writing \nfor someone whose eyes are flying across the \npage at lightspeed.\n• Alternate sentence length. If you read your \narticle and find most of your sentences and \nparagraphs are all the same length, you have \na rhythm problem. Short sentences should be \nfollowed by longer sentences. Longer sen -\ntences should be followed by short sentences. \nShort paragraphs should be followed by \nlong paragraphs, and really long paragraphs \nshould be followed by really short para -\ngraphs. As Mozart said, “Music is not in the \nnotes, but in the silence between.”  \n\n--- Page 249 ---\n\n241\nChapter 8• Write confidently and declaratively.  A lot \nof people hesitate to “make a point” or “take \na stance” when writing online because they \ndon’t want to get criticized in the comments. \nAs a result, their writing stands for noth -\ning, and resonates with no one. It’s safe. It’s \nself-conscious. And worst of all, it’s vague. \nThe more declarative you can be with your \nlanguage, the more you will force readers to \nmake a decision. Either they will say,  \n“I strongly agree,” or they will say, “I strongly \ndisagree.” Either of these responses is far \nbetter than, “Meh.”\n\n--- Page 250 ---\n\n242Chapter  9\nHow To Talk About Yourself \nWithout Making Your \nWriting All About “You”\nSelf-promotion on the internet follows the rule of opposites.\n• The more you promote yourself, the less \npeople listen.\n• The less you promote yourself, the more \npeople listen.\nCompanies and industry leaders make this mistake con -\nstantly, as do aspiring writers and storytellers. They want \npeople to know who they are, and so they write exclusively \nabout their company or themselves. They want people to \nknow about their new product, so they promote its bene -\nfits and features. In reality, people don’t care about either. \nPeople, especially consumers, only care about their own \ninterests and desires. If you can speak directly to those \ninterests and desires, then you can attract them as cus -\ntomers. If you can’t, then no amount of shouting from the \nrooftops is going to make them pay attention.\nYou are not the main character in your story.  \nThe reader is.\nThere is a nuance in what I am saying here.\n\n--- Page 251 ---\n\n243\nChapter 9I am not advocating for never talking about yourself, your \ncompany, or any of your products for sale. In fact, talking \nabout yourself, or the success of your products can often -\ntimes be important context and credibility for the reader. \nFor example, if I am reading a piece about real estate \ntrends, and the author of the piece says in the introduction, \n“I am the founder of a multi-billion-dollar real estate firm,” \nthat’s going to help me trust the opinions and insights \nbeing shared. The same goes for someone talking about \ntheir new book. If they let me, the reader, know this is \ntheir 8th New York Times  best-selling book, that’s going to \ngive me important context as to the credibility of the infor -\nmation being shared with me.\nUnfortunately, a lot of writers shy away from talking about \nthemselves in this way. I run into this with executives \nI work with who hesitate sharing any of their own personal \nexperiences out of fear of coming off too  “self-promo -\ntional.” What they fail to realize, however, is how much the \nreader actually wants to hear about these personal expe -\nriences. There’s just a difference between talking about \nyourself simply because you want to talk about yourself,  and \ntalking about yourself for the purpose of giving important \ncontext to the reader.\nThis is what I like to call  \nThe Golden Intersection.\nThe Golden Intersection is the single most effective way of \ntalking about yourself without being self-promotional.\nIf I tell you I am a 4x Top Writer on Quora with tens of mil -\nlions of views on my writing, and that’s the only thing I tell \nyou, then I seem like a self-centered egomaniac.\n\n--- Page 252 ---\n\n244\nChapter 9But if I tell you I’m a 4x Top Writer on Quora with tens of \nmillions of views on my writing, and I want to tell you how \nyou can become a Top Writer with tens of millions of views \non your own writing too , suddenly I don’t seem self-pro -\nmotional. I’m just letting you know where my insights are \ncoming from, and that I’m a credible source of information.\nThe difference between the former and the latter is that \nin the first example, I am the main character. I’m who is \nimportant, and I’m banking on the reader taking an inter -\nest in me.\nIn the latter, I am no longer the main character.\nYou are.\nI’m telling you how you can achieve your goal of becom -\ning a Top Writer on Quora—and, for context, here’s how \nI became a Top Writer on Quora myself.\nThe Golden Intersection of great writing is:   \nAnswering The Reader’s Question x T elling Them An \nEntertaining Story\nWhenever you are talking about yourself, it should be done \nin a way that gives necessary context to the reader.\n• If you’re writing about how to learn a skill, \nyou should also tell the reader how you \nlearned that skill.\n• If you’re writing about what it feels like \nto fall out of love, you should also tell the \nreader about a time you fell out of love.  \n\n--- Page 253 ---\n\n245\nChapter 9• If you’re writing about the future of tech -\nnology, you should also tell the reader about \nthe history of technology and what you’ve \nexperienced in the past.\n• If you’re writing about politics, you should \nalso tell the reader how you got involved in \npolitics.\nThe Golden Intersection puts the reader’s wants, needs, \nquestions, and desires as the #1 priority. This article is \nabout how you can learn a certain skill. This story is about \nhow you are feeling falling out of love. This piece is about \nhow you should be thinking about the future of technology. \nYou, you, you.\nThen, to give context to the information, and to make the \nexamples feel more relatable, I (as the writer) should let \nyou know where this information is coming from. This \narticle is about how you can learn a certain skill, “...and \nhow I learned that skill was by practicing for four hours, \nevery single day.” This story is about how you are feeling \nfalling out of love,” ...and I know, because when I was 25 \nyears old, I fell out of love too.” This piece is about how you \nshould be thinking about the future of technology,” ...and \nthat’s because I’ve interviewed hundreds of technologists \nover the past few years.”\nThe Art of Promoting Yourself\nNow, let’s say you want to promote a product.\nFor example, you just wrote a book titled, “Green At Home: \nHow To Grow Your Own Vegetable Farm In Your Kitchen \n(For Less Than $50 Per Month),” and you want everybody \n\n--- Page 254 ---\n\n246\nChapter 9to know about it. To get some exposure on the book, you \ndecide to start authoring articles on the internet, directing \nreaders to buy the paperback copy on Amazon.\nHere’s what most authors (including the ones signed with \nmajor publishing houses) do:\n• The author writes their very first piece \non Medium or Quora and then gets \nfrustrated when millions of people don’t \nimmediately read what they wrote.  “I’m \na successful writer,” they say to themselves. \n“More people should be reading my writing. \nThis platform must be broken.”\n• The author then hires a PR firm to get \ncolumnists to write about the wisdom \nbeing shared in their new book.  The \nPR firm has to then fight an uphill battle \nbecause most columnists know readers \ndon’t want to read an entire article about a \nproduct—readers only care about their own \nquestions, needs, and desires. When the PR \nfirm does finally get someone to write about \nthe book, the piece gets less than 1,000 \nviews because it’s a promotional piece (and \nagain, nobody wakes up in the morning \nexcited to read an advertisement).\n• The author finally decides to take mat -\nters into their own hands and start \nwriting on their blog. “Fine, I’ll do this \nmyself!” they shout. They write a blog post \ntitled, “The Book You Need To Read This \nSummer About Growing Your Own Vegetable \n\n--- Page 255 ---\n\n247\nChapter 9Farm.” On some level, the author intuitively \nunderstands they need to write for their \naudience, they just aren’t sure how to do that \nconsciously. And even if they get the title \nright, they end up writing an entire piece \nfilled with salesy language trying very hard \nto get the reader to go to Amazon and click \n“purchase.”\nThe Golden Intersection is the answer to \nall of these problems.\nThe problem here is that “the product” is being treated as \nthe main character.\nInstead, a more effective way of approaching The Golden \nIntersection would be to write about all the mistakes you \nmake when trying to start your own  farm at home—and \nthen telling readers how you (the author) made those same \nmistakes early on too. Or, writing about the amazing life \nlessons that can be learned by farming your own vegeta -\nbles at home, and then telling the stories of how you (the \nauthor) learned those same life lessons by farming your \nown vegetables at home too.\nThe Golden Intersection puts the reader first.\n• This piece is about their questions.\n• This piece is about their wants and needs.\n• This piece is about their desires.\nWhen you put the reader first, suddenly the moments you \ntalk about yourself aren’t really about yourself—they’re \nvisual examples of the points you’re making for the read -\n\n--- Page 256 ---\n\n248\nChapter 9er’s benefit. You’re telling a story that is showing  the \nanswer to the reader’s question.\nHere are a few examples of pieces you could write to \n“promote” this book:\n• 7 Mistakes People Make When Trying To \nGrow Vegetables At Home For The First Time\n• How To Grow Tomatoes In Your Own \nKitchen For Under $50 Per Month: 3 Easy \nSteps\n• The 1 Unforgettable Life Lesson You’ll Learn \nAs Soon As You Stop Going Grocery Shop -\nping—And Start Growing Your Own Food\nEach of these titles speaks to a particular pain point the \nreader might be experiencing: a question they have, a \nresult they want, a lifestyle they desire. Then, within each \none of these pieces, you can (and should) talk about how \nyou learned the very same thing the reader is looking to \nlearn, so the reader can better imagine themselves moving \nforward on their own path.\nThe single most effective way to “promote” yourself \nwithout promoting yourself is to use  you, your com -\npany, or your product as context  to the thing you’re \nexplaining to the reader.\nFor example, let’s say you’re writing the piece, “7 Mistakes \nPeople Make When Trying To Grow Vegetables At Home \nFor The First Time.”\n\n--- Page 257 ---\n\n249\nChapter 9In the third or fourth Main Point of the piece, you might say:\n“The fourth mistake people make is they start \nwith too many different vegetables. I tell this \nstory at length in my new book, “Green At \nHome: How To Grow Your Own Vegetable Farm \nIn Your Kitchen (For Less Than $50 Per Month),” \nbut the first time I tried growing veggies in \nmy kitchen, I ended up spending hundreds of \ndollars. I made the mistake of thinking the same \nstrategies that applied to growing tomatoes \ncould be used to grow zucchini and carrots and \nmicrogreens, etc. I ended up learning (the hard \nway) this is not the case.”\nThe very first sentence of this above paragraph is the most \nimportant one.\nBy first speaking directly to the reader’s questions, fears, \netc.—“The fourth mistake people make is they start with \ntoo many different vegetables”—any story you start telling \nthereafter is going to be seen as a reinforcement of that \nlesson or insight. The reader doesn’t feel like you’re ram -\nbling. The reader feels like you’re giving them context for \nhow you learned this same lesson yourself.\nAs a result, the piece reaches a wider number of readers \n(because it’s positioned as an answer to the target reader’s \nquestion).\nHere’s a different example.\nLet’s say you’re the founder of an advertising agency, and \nyou want to attract some all-star talent. You’re looking to \nexpand your content marketing department, and you really \n\n--- Page 258 ---\n\n250\nChapter 9want content marketing experts to reach out and apply to \nwork for your company.\nWhat most agencies do is the following:\n• The agency posts on social media \n(Facebook , Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.), \n“Come join our amazing family!” Since this \nis essentially an advertisement, nobody \nengages with it, which means the algorithms \ndon’t feed it to more people, which means \nnobody sees it.\n• The agency then writes up a job descrip -\ntion.  They go around and post this to as \nmany job boards and websites as possible, \nbut new applicants continue to be lackluster \nand stale.\n• The agency then gets frustrated and \ndecides to hire a PR firm.  They instruct the \nPR firm to find a columnist to write about \nthe amazing culture the agency has—and \nhow content marketing experts should apply. \nAgain, this is an uphill battle because most \ncolumnists know readers don’t wake up in \nthe morning excited to read an advertisement \nabout how great an agency’s culture is. And \nwhen the PR firm does finally find a colum -\nnist to write a piece about them, the article \ngets less than 1,000 views. Nobody cares.\nAs a result, hiring remains difficult for the agency—and \na significant amount of time, energy, and resources have \nbeen spent in the process.\n\n--- Page 259 ---\n\n251\nChapter 9The Golden Intersection is the answer to \nall of these problems.\nLet’s say I’m the agency owner.\nInstead of trying to promote myself and my agency, I should \nbe thinking about what questions my target reader is \nactively asking themselves. What are their wants, needs, \nand desires? And how can I make them “the main character” \nin my story?\nIf I want to hire content marketing experts, then my target \nreader is someone who is very knowledgeable about con -\ntent marketing and someone who is looking for a certain \ntype of work environment.\nHere are a few examples of pieces I could write to \nattract those types of readers:\n• 6 Tools Every Content Marketer Needs To \nBe Using In 2020 To Drive More Exposure, \nConvert More Customers, And Be 10x More \nProductive\n• 3 Reasons Why Every Digital Marketing \nAgency Should Have Their Own Internal \nContent Marketing Department\n• Are You A Freelance Content Marketer? Here \nAre 9 Clever Ways To Find More Clients\nAs a content marketer, these are the types of pieces you are \nmost likely reading on a regular basis. Your desires  are to \nmake more money, have more freedom, work with better \nclients, improve your skills, etc. Which means, if these are \n\n--- Page 260 ---\n\n252\nChapter 9the types of readers you want to reach, then these are the \nquestions you need to be answering for the reader’s benefit.\nNow let’s say you decide to write the piece, “6 Tools Every \nContent Marketer Needs To Be Using In 2020 To Drive \nMore Exposure, Convert More Customers, And Be 10x \nMore Productive.”\nIn the third or fourth Main Point of the piece, you can say:\n“The best content marketers are obsessive about \nusing data to measure success. One of the things \nwe do internally here at Digital Press is hold \nweekly workshops where our team of content \nmarketers will pull up that month’s search \nvolume for each client, and then brainstorm \ngrowth hacks we can all use to drive exposure. \nThis helps team members not feel like they’re \n“on an island” and solely responsible for finding \nall the answers themselves, while simultaneously \nbeing able to continue learning new skills and \nmastering the craft of content marketing. For \nexample, some of the growth hacks that have \ncome out of these sessions have been…”.\nIt’s very subtle, but in this example I am speaking directly \nto the wants and needs of a lonely but talented content \nmarketer who wants a job that will provide him or her \nopportunities to continue learning. I don’t need to spend \nan entire piece talking about my agency. In fact, doing so \nwould yield 10x less viewership. It’s much more effective to \ncasually mention a benefit relevant to the reader in a sen -\ntence or two as context to whatever it is I’m explaining.\n\n--- Page 261 ---\n\n253\nChapter 9Again, by talking about yourself “less,” viewership goes \nup—because I’m not making the piece about me, I’m \nmaking it about you, the reader.\nThe Art of Conversation\nThe advanced version of The Golden Intersection is what’s \ncommonly referred to as “The Humble Brag.”\nIf you’ve ever been to a fancy dinner party before, then \nyou know exactly what this sounds like. It’s the subtle \nturn of phrase an individual uses when they want to draw \nattention to something without making it seem like they’re \ndrawing attention to it at all.  It usually sounds like this:\n“That’s a great point. So I actually own a design firm over on \nSunset Boulevard—for context, we design clothes for Kanye \nWest, Beyoncé, Travis Scott, basically the who’s who in the \nentertainment industry—and one of the big things we’ve \nlearned about design trends is…”.\nListen closely, and in these conversations you will actually \nhear people say the words, “for context.” They are using \ntheir own accomplishments and achievements as credi -\nbility for whatever it is they’re talking about. When done \ntastefully, this can be a powerful strategy to give people \njust enough information to pique their interest. But when \ndone repeatedly, this becomes a neon sign that all you care \nabout is talking about yourself.\nTo execute this masterfully, here are some rules to follow:\n• Always bring things back to the read -\ner’s wants, needs, and desires. At no \npoint should your story or “for context” \n\n--- Page 262 ---\n\n254\nChapter 9information equal or exceed  the amount of \ntime you spend talking about the reader. The \nvast majority of everything you write should \nbe directed to answering your target reader’s \nquestions, or giving them valuable insight \nthat will move them one (or many) steps for -\nward in the direction of their own goals. One \nor two sentences about yourself is usually \nplenty. Remember: less is more.\n• Only mention information that is truly \nrelevant to the topic at hand.  If you’re \ntalking about content marketing, don’t plug \nyour sales tool just because. If you’re talking \nabout growing vegetables at home, don’t \npromote your friend’s vegan cookbook. If \nyou’re talking about clothing design, don’t \nrandomly say to your readers, “Which is \nwhy I’ve chosen to partner with Fiverr, for \nall your design needs.” The only time you \nshould be “promoting” something—whether \nit’s yourself, your company, or a specific \nproduct—is when that thing gives appropri -\nate context to the topic.\n• Make the thing you want to draw atten -\ntion to part of a larger point. You should \nnever dedicate an entire section, no matter \nhow big or small, to your own self-promotion. \nIt’s far more effective to embed the thing you \nwant to draw attention to within a thought, \nMain Point, or insight. For example, instead \nof dedicating an entire paragraph to your \nnew book, mention your book within a state -\n\n--- Page 263 ---\n\n255\nChapter 9ment directed at the reader’s benefit. Say \nsomething like, “I tell the story in full in my \nmemoir, Confessions of a Teenage Gamer , but \none of the first lessons I learned was…”.\n• Use casual language. You want any and all \nself-promotion to sound like part of the story \nyou’re telling. 99% of people who work in \nPR make this mistake by saying somewhere \nin the piece, “Enter: <Company Name>.” \nThey literally introduce the thing they’re \ntrying to promote with a massive spotlight—\nwhich immediately makes the reader feel \nlike they’re being sold to, and no longer the \ncenter of attention or “main character” of the \npiece. Instead, be more subtle. Use casual \nlanguage like, “I originally told this story in \nmy book,” or, “Before I started my first com -\npany, Digital Press…”. Self-promotion should \nnever feel like self-promotion. It should feel \nlike context. That’s it.\n• Make whatever it is you’re promoting “the \nsetting” for the story. If you’re writing a \npiece about workplace habits, you have the \nopportunity to promote your own company’s \nworkplace by making it the example  of what -\never insight you’re sharing with the reader. \nYou can say, “Positive workplace culture is \nextremely difficult to cultivate, but by practic -\ning these three daily rituals as a team, you’ll \nfind it can be nurtured quickly and effectively. \nFor example, every morning at Digital Press, \nthe first thing we do as a team is…”. Here, \n\n--- Page 264 ---\n\n256\nChapter 9I’m using my own company as an example of \nthe thing I’m explaining to the reader—not \nmaking it the “main character” itself.\nThe Art of CTAs\nA “Call To Action” is a way of directing readers to a specific \nproduct, service, or company you want to promote.\nThe simplest way of executing a CTA is to put it in the \nsignature of the article. Again, at no point in time do you \nwant the reader to feel like they’re being sold to, or that \nthey are being treated as the second priority. An easy way \nof avoiding this issue is to separate the interests of the \nreader (the piece itself) and your own by placing any links \nor sales pitches at the very end of the piece.\nFor example, once I had started building an audience for \nmyself on Quora, I wanted to direct those readers to my \nwebsite (to capture their email addresses) and my com -\npany website (to attract new clients). So, at the end of all \nmy articles, I linked to both a valuable resource for target \nreaders, as well as the Digital Press website. My signature \nlooked like this:\nThanks for reading! :)\nWant to learn how I built my Personal Brand \nonline, attracting over 50 million readers?\nClick here to take the free Personal Branding \nemail course!\nWant to work with Digital Press? Check us out!\n\n--- Page 265 ---\n\n257\nChapter 9By placing this signature at the end of every article, I was \nable to give readers the option  of clicking elsewhere if they \nwanted to, without making them feel taken advantage of \nor “sold to” within the article itself.\nThis is one way of executing a CTA.\nA better, less obvious strategy for inserting a Call \nTo Action into a piece is to make the CTA a credible \nexample of whatever it is you’re talking about.\nFor example, let’s say you’re writing a piece about personal \nbranding, and you want to send people to your “Free Per -\nsonal Branding Email Course.”\nInstead of placing this CTA in the signature of your article, \nyou can embed the link inside a relevant paragraph. In one \nof your Main Points, you can say something like, “Personal \nbranding can be a difficult marketing strategy for people \nto execute on their own. I have been helping people build \ntheir personal brands online for more than five years now, \nand more than 10,000 people have taken my free personal \nbranding email course (link), explaining step-by-step what \ngoes into building a personal brand on the internet. \nHere, the CTA and “credibility statement” are being com -\nbined into one.\nThis is a great way of drawing attention to something \nyou want a reader to know about, without making it the \nfocal point of the piece. If the reader is interested in a free \npersonal branding email course, they’ll click. And if they’re \nnot, their eyes will just skim right over it and continue \nreading.\nNo harm done.\n\n--- Page 266 ---\n\n258\nChapter 9The final way of executing a Call To Action, without \nruining the reading experience, is to link to your website, \ncompany, or product without any overt explanation.\nFor example, instead of actually saying, “I have been \nhelping people build their personal brands online for more \nthan five years now, and more than 10,000 people have \ntaken my free personal branding email course (link),” you \nwould instead just say, “I have been helping people build \ntheir personal brands online for more than five years now,” \nand link the phrase, “…helping people build their personal \nbrands online” to your free personal branding email course.\nWhat you’re doing here is associating a specific phrase \nwithin a sentence to whatever asset or product you want \npeople to know about. Here, the words in the sentence \nactually say “helping people,” so when paired with a link, \nit’s safe to say a reader will think to themselves, “Well, I’m \nlooking for help—I wonder where this goes.” Instead of \ncalling out your product or service directly, you’re letting \nthe reader discover it on their own.\nMy personal preference when it comes to CTAs is to always \nmake them feel like helpful and relevant resources for the \nreader, but to never give them the spotlight. Very little is \ngained by trying to hard-sell readers on anything. Instead, \nit’s far better to not try to sell them at all, and to just make \nwhatever it is you do want to promote easily accessible.\nIf the reader wants what you have to offer, trust they’ll \ntake it upon themselves to navigate there on their own.\nAnd if they don’t, let them continue reading in peace.\nOtherwise they won’t want to read any more of your mate -\nrial.\n\n--- Page 267 ---\n\n259Chapter  10\nYour Content Roadmap: \nConstructing A “Sticky Web” \nFor Your Writing\nAnyone can follow all these rules and write one really \ngreat article.\nThe real question is, can you write 1,000 of them?\nWriters who succeed on the internet are the ones with the \nlargest libraries of content. Sure, there are outliers who \nhappen to find success with just a small batch of material, \nbut 99% of the time, volume is what separates “good” from \n“great.” The more material you have, the more times you’re \n“spinning the wheel” of social algorithms, and the more \nlikely new readers are to discover you and your work.\nIn the game of Online Writing, volume wins.\nEvery time you write something online, your footprint gets \nbigger.\nThe more material you write within a given category, the \nmore dominant your voice becomes.\nAnd the longer you stick with it, new writers in your chosen \ncategory  will start to compare themselves to you.\nHow?\n\n--- Page 268 ---\n\n260\nChapter 10The first way is to take a timely  approach.\nTimely writers write about what’s happening right now . \nThese are BuzzFeed  writers chasing the next pop culture \ntrend, Wall Street Journal  columnists chasing the next viral \nnews story, and people on social media adding commen -\ntary to today’s hot topics.\nThe beauty of timely content is that it has a much higher \nlikelihood of catching fire immediately—simply because \nyou’re riding the wave of mass attention. When I wrote \nfor Inc Magazine,  some of my most-popular articles piggy -\nbacked on events happening in the news: Mark Zuckerberg \nmaking an announcement, the Golden State Warriors win -\nning a championship, etc. Since search volume and social \nmedia engagement around those topics was high, those \npieces received a disproportionate amount of attention in \nthe short term.\nUnfortunately, timely content is a double-edged sword.\nIf you think of your writing over the span of 10 years \n(opposed to 10 days), these timely pieces have a very \nshort shelf life. It wouldn’t make sense for me to re-pub -\nlish or re-share my article about an announcement Mark \nZuckerberg made seven years ago. I would need to do \na considerable amount of re-writing in order to make that \n“same article” relevant today—and in most cases, I’d be \nbetter off just writing something new.\nIn this sense, only writing timely material makes it difficult \nto build a library of content that lasts.\n\n--- Page 269 ---\n\n261\nChapter 10The second way to think about writing \nonline is to take a timeless  approach.\nThese are stories, opinions, insights, lists, and guides that \nwill stand the test of time. They could be read today, or \nthey could be re-read ten years from now, and they would \nstill remain valuable to the reader. The principles are \nuniversal.\nOf course, not everything you write will remain a “perfect” \nreflection of how you think or feel over the long term. For \nexample, some of the things I wrote in 2014, 2015, and \n2016, I no longer agree with—or would explain differently \ntoday. And that’s OK. Because for every piece where that’s \nthe case, there are ten more I re-read and think to myself, \n“Wow, I completely forgot I worded it this way—this is \ngreat.” What’s important is that I, as the writer, have the \noption of making that decision for myself (opposed to the \ndecision being made for me simply because a topic is no \nlonger relevant).\nTimeless content very rarely commands the same level of \nhype that a trendy, hyper-relevant, timely piece receives \nin the moment. It’s hard to compete against something the \nentire country, or even the entire world is fixated on for \n24-48 hours. However, where timeless content “wins” is \nin its ability to endure. A timely article might accumulate \n10,000 views in a day, and then fade into the abyss—\nwhereas a timeless article might accumulate 5,000 views \nevery year for ten years.\nAnd I much prefer the latter.\nThe reason timeless content is a better long-term investment \n\n--- Page 270 ---\n\n262\nChapter 10is because you can continue to reuse, re-publish, and \nre-share this content long into the future. The more you \nwrite, the bigger your library of usable  content grows. The \nmore your library grows, the larger of a footprint you can \nnow bring to any new writing platform. The larger of a \nfootprint you can bring to new platforms, the faster you will \neffectively position yourself as “the king” of your chosen \ncategory —and over time, this flywheel will continue to spin \nfaster and faster.\nFor example, one of the reasons I was able to grow so \nquickly on Medium was because I already had 2,000+ \nusable articles in my library of content.\nI didn’t start writing on Medium until 2017. By then, there \nwere already millions and millions of writers on the \nplatform (admittedly, I joined the game a bit late). How -\never, I had been writing daily on Quora for almost three \nyears, and had amassed a library of content at my disposal. \nSo, I started taking all my old material and republishing \nit on Medium, one article per day. Between 2017 and \n2020, I wrote less than 30 original pieces on Medium. All \nof it was previous material from my library, just with a \nnew title and a new picture—and in my first year on the \nplatform, I accumulated tens of thousands of followers, \nmillions of views, and became a Top Writer in more than \n15 different categories.\nAll from old material.\nNow, had I been exclusively writing timely  content on \nQuora, I wouldn’t have been able to do that. Nobody on \nMedium would have wanted to read opinion articles about \nnews events that happened two years in the past. The \nvalue of my library came from the fact that 99% of it was \n\n--- Page 271 ---\n\n263\nChapter 10timeless—in the sense that I could re-publish the same \narticle three years later, and it would still read the same \nway, and still provide relevant value. This is what I like to \ncall “earning dividends” on content you created historically.\nSo, in the game of online writing, it’s not just that volume \nwins.\nIt’s that timeless  volume wins.\nContent Buckets\nTo get the most “return on investment” from your writing, \nit’s important to have a roadmap for success.\nI firmly believe the first six months on the internet, for any \nwriter, should be spent exploring, practicing, and gather -\ning data. Even for our clients at Digital Press, we would \nexplain that the first three months were largely about gath -\nering data. We’d then author a handful of pieces with them \nin a variety of categories, and as data told us what people \nwere engaging with, we would narrow down their topic \nareas to clearly define their three “content buckets.”\nThe three types of “content buckets” I recommend \nare:\n1. General Audience:  You should have one \nbucket that is aimed at universal topics. \nThings like positive habits, life lessons, pro -\nductivity topics, etc., are big, broad categories \nthat resonate with the widest number of \npeople. How you make them relevant to \nyou is by approaching them through your \nown specific lens. Let’s say you’re the VP of \n\n--- Page 272 ---\n\n264\nChapter 10Marketing at a software company. You should \nwrite about life lessons learned as the VP of \nMarketing at a software company , or time \nmanagement techniques you use day in and \nday out as The VP of Marketing at a software \ncompany . This same logic applies no matter \nwho you are. You could be a poet, a foodie, \nor a master salesman, and there is still \nmassive benefit in targeting universal topics \nthrough your own specific lens.\n2. Niche Audience: Your second content bucket \nshould be hyper-relevant to your expertise. If \nyou’re the VP of Marketing, then your niche \naudience would be “marketers”—and refined \nfurther, maybe “content marketers.” When \nspeaking to this audience, you have the \noption of continuing to leverage universal \ntopics to broaden your reach, or intentionally \nexcluding general audiences by speaking \ndirectly to the intimate pain points your \ntarget reader is experiencing. My recommen -\ndation is to do both.\n3. Company/Industry Audience: Your third \ncontent bucket is the environment and indus -\ntry you exist within. If you’re a violinist, you \nshould be writing about the violin industry. If \nyou’re a music producer, you should be writ -\ning about the music production industry. If \nyou own a SaaS business, you should be writ -\ning about software as a service and the SaaS \nindustry at large. If you are a writer, you \nshould be writing about writing (in your spe -\n\n--- Page 273 ---\n\n265\nChapter 10cific genre). This third bucket is usually the \neasiest to pinpoint, however it’s an important \none to add into the mix in order to be “seen” \nas a leader in your chosen category .\nFor example, here are my three content buckets:\n1. General Audience:  Life advice, personal \ndevelopment, and self-mastery as it relates \nto my own life experiences as a writer and \nentrepreneur (and previously as a body -\nbuilder and professional gamer).\n2. Niche Audience:  Online writing advice, \nself-publishing, and content marketing.\n3. Company/Industry Audience:  Thought \nleadership and personal branding, specifi -\ncally for executives, founders, investors, etc.\nNow, it’s important to remember that your content buckets \ncan, and most likely will change over time. When I first \nstarted writing on Quora, I experimented with a ton of \ndifferent Niche Audiences before data told me what people \nreally wanted to hear about from me most. I wrote about \ngaming, I wrote about bodybuilding, I wrote about big \nbrand advertising campaigns, etc. Eventually, I learned it \nwas really my perspectives on writing and content market -\ning that attracted the most consistent attention as a “niche,” \nso I doubled down on that.\n\n--- Page 274 ---\n\n266\nChapter 10Endless Idea Generator\nAnyone who says, “I don’t have that much to say,” doesn’t \nknow the secret to coming up with endless ideas.\nWriting anything on the internet follows a very simple \n3-step process.\nStep 1: What “Type” Of Writing Is This?\nForm #1:  Actionable Guide\nForm #2:  Opinion\nForm #3:  Curated List\nForm #4:  Story\nForm #5:  Credible Talking Head\nStep 2: What “Idea” Am I Communicating Within This \nPiece Of Writing?\nIdea #1:  Explanation (When/Where/How/What/\nWhy Something Happens)\nIdea #2:  Habits (To Achieve A Destination, Goal, \nOr State Of Being)\nIdea #3:  Mistakes (Keeping You From Achieving \nA Destination, Goal, Or State Of Being)\nIdea #4:  Lessons (Learned In Pursuit Of A Desti -\nnation, Goal, Or State Of Being)\nIdea #5:  Tips (That Can Help You In Your Own \nPursuit Of A Destination, Goal, Or State Of Being)\n\n--- Page 275 ---\n\n267\nChapter 10Idea #6:  Stories (That Symbolize Or Explain \nSome Aspect Of The Pursuit Of A Destination, \nGoal, Or State Of Being)\nIdea #7:  Timely Events (That Are Relevant To \nThe Target Reader’s Knowledge, Awareness, Or \nPursuit Of A Destination, Goal, Or State Of Being)\nIf you notice, timely “this just happened” con -\ntent is only one of seven types of ideas that are \ncommunicated in written content—and yet, \nwriters disproportionately give them priority in \ntheir libraries. Instead, I recommend you give \ntimely content the smallest allocation of your \nwriting portfolio. Take advantage of opportuni -\nties when they present themselves, but invest the \nmajority of your time in building timeless assets \nyou will be able to repurpose and reuse (and will \npay you dividends) years into the future.\nStep 3: Why Me?\nCredibility #1:  “I am an expert on this topic. \nHere’s what I think.”\nCredibility #2:  “I went out and talked to all \nthe trusted experts on this topic. Here are all \ntheir insights and opinions in one place.”\nCredibility #3:  “I’m just sharing my opinion, \nbut my opinion is the most articulate one of all.”\nWhen you combine these three steps together, you \nsuddenly get a very easy (and replicable) equation for con -\nsistently writing high-quality, high-performing content.\n\n--- Page 276 ---\n\n268\nChapter 10For example:\n• Curated List x Mistakes x 7 Industry \nExperts (Credibility #2)  = the outline of \nan article titled, “7 Founders Share The Big -\ngest Mistakes They Made Raising Money For \nTheir First Startups”\n• Credibility x Explanation (Why) x Expert \n(Credibility #1) = the outline of an arti -\ncle titled, “I Was A Professional World Of \nWarcraft Gamer As A Teenager. Here’s Why \neSports Is Going To Become A Multi-Billion- \nDollar Industry”\n• Opinion x Lessons x My Perspective  \n(Credibility #3)  = the outline of an article \ntitled, “Our Country’s Economy Is Falling \nApart. Here’s What That Looks Like For Some -\none Living In A Low-Income Neighborhood”)\nGo down the list, combine steps 1, 2, and 3, and you’ll \nhave the outline of a piece of content just waiting to be \nwritten.\nContent Roadmap T emplate\nOnce you’ve pinpointed three content buckets you want to \nstart with, and you’ve come up with a handful of working \nheadlines using the Endless Idea Generator, you just plug \nand play to create your Content Roadmap.\n\n--- Page 277 ---\n\n269\nChapter 10Step 1: List Your 3 Content Buckets\nEach of these will be the categories you are looking to \ntarget over the long term.\n• General Audience  (Example: Productivity)\n• Niche Audience  (Example: Project Manage -\nment Software)\n• Company/Industry (Example: Software As \nA Service)\nStep 2: List 3+ Topics Under Each Bucket\nWithin each bucket, pinpoint a few overarching topics \nyou want to become an “influential voice” on, and write \nactively about.\n• General Audience  (Example: Productivity)\n »Productivity Tips\n »Time Management Techniques\n »Curated Productivity Insights\n• Niche Audience  (Example: SaaS Startups)\n »Startup Advice\n »SaaS Insights\n »Founder Stories\n• Company/Industry (Example: Project Man -\nagement Software)\n »History Of Project Management Software\n »Trends In Project Management Software\n »New Research / Data In Project Management\n\n--- Page 278 ---\n\n270\nChapter 10Step 3: Plug And Play Under Each Topic\nThen, underneath each Audience, and then each Topic, use \nthe Endless Idea Generator to come up with hundreds of \nworking headlines.\n• General Audience  (Example: Productivity)\n »Productivity Tips\n –HOW TO be more productive\n ·How X Startup Entrepreneurs, Pro Ath -\nletes, And Billionaires Stay Productive\n ·How Anyone Can Be More Productive \nWith These X Small Shifts In Their \nMorning Routine\n ·How To Achieve Work-Life Balance \nWithout Getting Fired\n –WAYS to be more productive\n ·X Little-Known Ways To Make Yourself \nMore Productive On A Daily Basis\n ·X Unconventional Ways <insert \nhigh-profile individual> Stays Produc -\ntive On A Daily Basis\n ·X Unique Ways To Get More Work Done \nIn 5x Less Time\n ·X Inexpensive Software Products That \nWill Help You Be More Productive\n\n--- Page 279 ---\n\n271\nChapter 10 –THOUGHT LEADER RECOMMENDATIONS \non how to be more productive\n ·What Michael Jordan’s Training Sched -\nule Can Teach Us About Productivity\n ·Oprah’s Morning Routine Will Inspire \nYou To Be More Productive.

Here’s How You Can \nEmpower Them To Do So\nI know—that’s a lot of headlines.\nThe reason I wanted to actually show you what a Content \nRoadmap looks like though is so you can see how easy it is \nto come up with ideas. Using the Endless Idea Generator, \nyou should never run out of things to write about. Ever. \nSomething else I want to point out is that within this road -\nmap are some redundancies. Certain ideas could fall under \ndifferent buckets. Others can exist within two buckets. Etc. \n\n--- Page 288 ---\n\n280\nChapter 10Personally, I don’t see this as a bad thing. Part of establish -\ning yourself as an “influential voice” within your chosen \ncategory  is writing at-length about the same handful of \ntopics, and continuing to find new ways to approach them. \nIn this sense, repetition is a good thing—not a bad thing.\nLastly, every time you sit down to write, I encourage \nyou to ask yourself these three questions:\n1. “Does this idea fall within one of my three \ncontent buckets?” (If not, what can you \ntweak so that it makes more sense in the \ncontext of your library?)\n2. “Will this piece stand the test of time?” (If not, \nwhat can you change to make it less timely \nand more timeless?)\n3. “Have I already written about this?”  \n(If yes, how can you re-tell those same stories, \ninsights, opinions, etc., in a way that gives \nthe reader a new and different experience?)\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve written the phrase, \n“When I was 17 years old, I became one of the high -\nest-ranked World of Warcraft players in North America.” \nAnd yet, every time I’ve told that story, I’ve told it through \na slightly different lens. In one piece I wrote about how \nplaying video games taught me about work ethic. In \nanother, I wrote about the life lessons I learned being \nobsessed with something at such an early age. In another, \nI wrote about the fallacy of achievement, and how external \nrewards don’t last forever. In another, I wrote about my \nrelationship with my parents as a teenager being obsessed \nwith World of Warcraft.\n\n--- Page 289 ---\n\n281\nChapter 10It’s the same “story,” but told hundreds of different ways.\nAs a result, “When I was 17 years old, I became one of the \nhighest-ranked World of Warcraft players in North Amer -\nica” became one of my “core narratives.” And now, every \ntime I speak on a podcast, or connect with someone new \nover the internet, this narrative almost always comes up—\nbecause people have learned to associate it with me, and \nme with it.\nRemember: repetition is how you reinforce who you are, \nwhat you know, and what life experiences are informing \nyour writing, perspective, and unique point of view.\nRepetition is how you get people to remember “you.”\n\n--- Page 290 ---\n\n282Chapter  11\nPillar Pieces: How To Turn \nProven Online Writing Into \nLonger, More Valuable Assets\nAs we talked about at the beginning of this book, your \n“Writing Data Flywheel” is your mechanism for endless \ninspiration.\nMore importantly, your “Writing Data Flywheel” becomes \nyour unfair advantage within your chosen category.\nThe longer you stick with writing online, the more data \nyou will accumulate about what topics resonate with the \nmost people, what headline styles work best for you and \nyour content, what piece structures and styles keep readers \nengaged the longest, etc. For example, when you see that \none of your articles, social media posts, or short stories \nis outperforming every other piece of content you’ve ever \nwritten, you shouldn’t just see that as a “win” and move on. \nYou should question why this piece in particular is resonat -\ning with so many people—and how you can expand it into \na longer, more valuable asset.\nThis is the answer to the question, “When should I launch \nmy own website?”\nYou are ready to launch your own website when you’ve \nreached a point where your writing can in some way, shape, \nor form become a business. Again, 99% of writers and \n\n--- Page 291 ---\n\n283\nChapter 11industry leaders want to start here, but it’s premature. They \nend up spending an unnecessary amount of time trying to \nfigure out how to capture and keep people’s attention , when \nthey could have easily answered that question by Practicing \nIn Public and letting data give them the answer.\nWriting becomes a business as soon as you start:\n• Capturing people’s email addresses\n• Making money from advertising revenue\n• Making money from paid subscriptions\n• Selling products and/or services\n• Speaking, coaching, consulting, and/or \nadvising\nSo if this is the goal, then it makes sense to let data \ninform where you choose to invest more time, energy, and \nresources next.\nTurning Articles Into Pillar Pieces\nIt’s time to start your own website once you 1) know what \nit is people want to read about from you, 2) know how you \nneed to position topics to resonate with your target readers, \nand 3) already have their attention elsewhere and are ready \nto move them deeper into your library of content.\nFor example, let’s say you’ve written a dozen or so pieces \nabout sales advice, but there was one article in particular \nabout “cold email outreach” that outperformed the rest.\nStep one  would be to double down on this topic and con -\ntinue Practicing In Public to make sure this wasn’t a fluke. \nIs there more data confirming that “cold email outreach” \n\n--- Page 292 ---\n\n284\nChapter 11is a content bucket that is performing well and resonating \nwith your target readers? If yes, you should refine your \noriginal content bucket (Niche Audience: Sales) to be more \nspecific (Niche Audience: Cold Email Outreach For Sales).\nStep two  begins once you’ve confirmed these hypotheses. \nYou’ve written more extensively about “cold email out -\nreach” and sales strategies specific to this target audience, \nand you’ve clearly seen this audience is engaging with the \ninsight you’re bringing to the table.\nYou have their attention—now you want to do something \nwith it.\nIn order to start capturing people’s email addresses, or \ndirecting them to some sort of paid product, you are going \nto need to move these readers from whatever platform \nthey’re on over to your own website. The difference how -\never, and why I believe it’s so important to first start in \nsocial environments , is now you know exactly how to greet \nthem when they walk through the door. You know your \ntarget audience wants to learn more about “cold email \noutreach” strategies to achieve their sales goals—so you \nposition that, first. Maybe on your website you even say, \n“Looking for cold email outreach strategies? You’ve come to \nthe right place.” Again, imagine how hard it would be to \nfigure out the best way to “position” yourself without any \nof this data. You’d be banging your head against your desk, \nbeyond frustrated.\nNow, one thing I want to stress here is that just because \nyou have someone’s attention on a social platform like \nQuora, Medium, LinkedIn, etc., doesn’t mean they’re \ngoing to keep giving you their attention. In fact, anytime \nyou ask a reader to move from where they already are to \n\n--- Page 293 ---\n\n285\nChapter 11somewhere else (especially your own website), you actually \nhave to work harder  to keep their attention. Every second \nthey spend on your site, they are subconsciously asking \nthemselves, “Why am I still here?”\nSo, don’t just meet their expectations.\nExceed them.\nThe best way to continue earning a reader’s loyalty is to \ndirect them from a piece of written content they already \nfind valuable, to a longer, more extensive resource \nthey will want to bookmark forever.\n“Pillar Pieces” are the most valuable, most comprehensive, \nmost insightful, and most engaging  versions of pieces that \nhave proven themselves elsewhere.\nInstead of sending readers from an article on a social \nplatform to the homepage of your website, what you want \nto do is exceed  their expectations by giving them a longer, \nmore extensive resource they almost can’t believe you’re \ngiving away for free. If they thought your articles and writ -\nten content on social platforms were valuable, they should \nbe blown away by how in-depth your “Pillar Pieces” are \non your website. If they enjoyed the short stories you were \nsharing on Medium or Twitter, they should be amazed you \ndecided to publish what could have easily been an excerpt \nfrom a book (or hell, an entire book ) for free on your blog.\nThe idea here is to make sure the first interaction a reader \nhas with you on your own website  is an incredibly positive \none. They shouldn’t feel like you’re tricking them into \nspending time on your site. Instead, they should feel like \nyou are taking them by the hand and walking them to the \n\n--- Page 294 ---\n\n286\nChapter 11next most valuable, most relevant  piece of writing in your \nlibrary.\n“But Cole, I’ve already said everything I wanted to say \nabout this topic in the first article I wrote.”\nNo, you haven’t.\nHere are five easy ways to take a proven topic and expand \nit into a timeless  Pillar Piece.\n• Combine Content:  If you’ve written a dozen \narticles about “cold email outreach strat -\negies,” combine the best parts of them all \ninto one comprehensive guide. Or, if you’ve \nwritten hundreds of tweets about writing \nadvice or cooking advice or fitness advice, \nyou should combine them into a Pillar Piece \ntitled, “100 Tweets That Will Teach You \nEverything You Need To Know About Cook -\ning Gluten-Free At Home.” The benefit here \nfor the reader is convenience. Instead of \nthem having to scroll through three years \nof tweets, or hundreds and hundreds of \nMedium articles, you’ve done them the favor \nof curating all the best, most relevant pieces \nof information into one comprehensive piece \nthat lives on your site.\n• Curate Expert Opinions:  It’s one thing to \nshare your own opinions and insights, but \nit’s even better if you can reinforce those \ninsights from credible people. Interview \nexperts in your industry and add quotes \nfrom them throughout your Pillar Piece.  \n\n--- Page 295 ---\n\n287\nChapter 11Pull from interviews they’ve given on pod -\ncasts and in major publications. You can \neven quote insights they share on their own \nwebsites or social content. The more helpful \ninformation you can curate, so long as it’s \nrelevant to the reader , the better.\n• Add Statistics: Nothing makes a piece feel \n“more professional” than adding a few highly \nrelevant stats or takeaways from credible \nstudies. You can very easily elongate proven \ncontent by adding additional research the \nreader would have otherwise had to find for \nthemselves.\n• Tell Personal Stories:  If the target range \nof a piece of written content online is 800 – \n1,200 words, then that doesn’t leave a lot \nof room to tell many in-depth stories. The \nbeauty of turning proven material into Pillar \nPieces, however, is that you can share much \nmore with the reader— so long as it’s relevant . \nIn each Main Point, explain to the reader \nhow you learned this same lesson or piece \nof advice for yourself. Divulge interesting \ndetails. Give them the stuff they might not \nknow about you—and wouldn’t normally \ncome across in your other content.\n• Provide More Examples: This book is \na great example. One version of this book \ncould have been 800 words. Another ver -\nsion could have been 5,000 words. Another \nversion could have been 25,000 words. The \n\n--- Page 296 ---\n\n288\nChapter 11reason why this book ended up being as \nlong as it did was because I wanted to give \nyou (the reader) a ton  of examples. I didn’t \njust want to explain a point and then move \non—I wanted you to see first-hand how \nthese writing strategies worked, so that you \ncould integrate them into your own writing \ntoo. The same goes for Pillar Pieces. You can \nvery easily turn an 800-word article into \na 5,000 word “Ultimate Guide” by giving the \nreader dozens of concrete examples.\nNotice, I am not encouraging you to inflate the word count \nand just “make the piece longer.”\nI’m encouraging you to find ways to make this one individ -\nual piece, on one individual topic, as potent as possible.\nOnce you have a Pillar Piece written on \na specific topic, you should then direct \nreaders over and over again to this Pillar \nPiece in your relevant social content.\nThis becomes your “Reader Acquisition Flywheel.”\n• Write content in each of your three Content \nBuckets.\n• Use data to decide which specific topic \ndeserves its own Pillar Piece.\n• Create a Pillar Piece on your website.  \n\n--- Page 297 ---\n\n289\nChapter 11• Continue to write about that proven topic in \nsocial environments, and regularly link to \nthat Pillar Piece in everything you write that \nis relevant.\nFor example, let’s say you write a Pillar Piece on your web -\nsite titled, “The Ultimate Guide To Cold Email Outreach: 9 \nSteps To $100,000 In Monthly Revenue.”\nEvery time you write about “cold email outreach” (speak -\ning to your Niche Audience) on social platforms like \nTwitter, Quora, Medium, LinkedIn, etc., you now have the \noption of elegantly directing readers to your website with-\nout making them feel sold to .\nThis goes back to “the art of talking about yourself without \ntalking about yourself.”\nYou could write a Medium article titled, “3 Mistakes Most \nFreelancers Make Using Cold Email Outreach To Get New \nClients,” and within one of the Main Points of the article \nsay, “Another one of the mistakes I see freelancers make \nis they treat cold email outreach the same way they treat \nemailing their friends and family members. They don’t write \nwith the person they’re trying to reach in mind. For example, \nI know many freelancers who try to target C-level executives \nwith cold email, but end up sending them 500+ word emails. \nThis is a big mistake, because most CEOs don’t have the \ntime to read 50-word emails, let alone 500-word emails. I \nexplain why super short emails are far more effective in my \nultimate guide to cold email outreach , but the important \nthing I want you to remember is that brevity is key.”\nThen, you could write another, different article on Linke -\ndIn titled, “Why Cold Email Outreach Is The Single Most \n\n--- Page 298 ---\n\n290\nChapter 11Effective B2B Sales Strategy In 2020,” and within one of \nthe Main Points of the piece say, “Anyone not using cold \nemail outreach in 2020 is massively disadvantaged. At the \nbeginning of the year, I published a resource on my site, \n“The Ultimate Guide To Cold Email Outreach: 9 Steps \nTo $100,000 In Monthly Revenue,”  and in that guide I \nexplained how companies with cold email strategies outper -\nformed companies without cold email strategies.\nAnd so on.\nBy connecting Pillar Pieces to your Content Buckets, you \nwill eventually have hundreds and hundreds of content \npieces pointing to your website in a way that is non-intru -\nsive for the reader. Instead, readers will feel like they just \nstumbled onto a goldmine—first, discovering one of your \npieces in a social environment, and then within that piece, \ndiscovering an even more valuable, even more relevant piece \nof writing.\nThis is how your library of content starts to become \na super-sticky web.\nTurning Pillar Pieces Into Email Courses, \nNewsletters, And Free Downloads\nOnce you have readers on your site, now it’s time to cap -\nture their email addresses.\nThe same way you want to turn proven articles into Pillar \nPieces, you also want to turn proven articles and Pillar \nPieces into longer, more valuable resources and products. \nAgain, instead of “wondering” what you should create next, \nlet data tell you. If you’re seeing one Pillar Piece is getting \n\n--- Page 299 ---\n\n291\nChapter 11significantly more traffic than the others, you should con -\nsider turning that in-depth piece into an even longer, even \nmore valuable downloadable PDF worksheet or guide, or \neven a 7-day email course for beginners, etc.\nThe idea here is to never make the reader feel like they’re \nbeing presented with something “out of context.”\nWhat you want to do is build a road for them to \nfollow:\n• They click on an article that speaks to their \ninterests\n• Within that article, they see a link to a more \nvaluable resource that speaks to their inter -\nests\n• Within that Pillar Piece, they are presented \nwith an even more valuable resource  that \nspeaks to their interests\n• And so on\nUnfortunately, most writers (including the content writers \nand marketers within multi-billion-dollar companies) aren’t \nthis thoughtful with their readers and customers. Instead, \nthey badger them with advertising that says, “Sign up \nfor our newsletter!” or “Click here to download our FREE \nreport!” What they fail to realize, however, is that read -\ners don’t just “sign up” for things. Readers don’t just give \naway their email addresses and long-term loyalty because \nyou presented them with an offer (“Join my newsletter for \nmore of my thoughts!”). The same way people make judge -\nments about what to read on the internet, they also make \n(even harsher) judgements about what to opt-in for on \n\n--- Page 300 ---\n\n292\nChapter 11someone’s website—which means your offer has to be even \nmore relevant, and even more valuable  than all the written \ncontent they’ve consumed of yours thus far.\nHow most writers go about solving for this is by with -\nholding their best content.\n“Well, if my goal is to capture email addresses and make \nmoney, then I should only give away a little bit of my writ -\ning for free. I should make them have to download or pay \nfor the rest.”\nAs a result, their writing in social environments never \ncatches on (because it’s all fluff masked as a sales pitch), \nwhich means their Pillar Pieces never get any traffic \n(because nobody is reading their social content in the first \nplace), which means nobody ends up opting-in or purchas -\ning anything on their site. Frustrated, they throw their \nhands in the air and say, “Writing on the internet is broken. \nIt doesn’t work.” And then, if they’re a company or wealthy \nindividual, they go hire an agency that specializes in Face -\nbook Ads so they can throw money at the problem.\nAgain, I encourage you to flip the script.\nGive away 99% of your best writing for free.\nPlay the long game. Become the most-read, most-valuable \nwriter in your chosen category . Your goal should be for \nreaders to tag you on Twitter and say, “I seriously can’t \nbelieve all this amazing content is free.” Your only problem \nshould be having too much of people’s attention , and not \nhaving enough hours in the day to capture it all. That’s far \nbetter than not being able to get people’s attention in the \nfirst place.\n\n--- Page 301 ---\n\n293\nChapter 11So, if you’ve already written hundreds of articles on \na given topic, and you’ve already created a handful of \ninsanely valuable Pillar Pieces on your site, how do you \nkeep pushing yourself to create even more valuable, even \nmore relevant resources readers can download or opt-in \nand receive?\nIn addition to the ways I mentioned earlier (turning arti -\ncles into Pillar Pieces), here are a few more:\n• Speak To 1 Hyper-Specific Problem:  Just \nlike articles, the best email captures speak \nto highly sensitive issues within readers. For \nexample, if you write often about building \nyour real estate portfolio, you could create \na 7-day email course titled, “7 Days To \nBuying Your First Rental Property.” Even \nthough readers have consumed your other \ncontent, this feels like a hyper-specific solu -\ntion to a problem they’re facing (“How do \nI buy my VERY FIRST rental property?”)—\nand the idea of being walked through the \nprocess over 7 days feels helpful.\n• Curate Credible Case Studies:  Another \nproven opt-in format is to create your own \ncase studies of well-known success stories in \nyour industry. For example, let’s say you are \na fiction writer, but you also write articles \n(and have a handful of Pillar Pieces) about \nhow to earn a living as a fiction writer. You \ncould create a downloadable PDF titled, “10 \nFiction Writers Who Earn $100,000+ Per Year \nBy Self-Publishing On Amazon.” Now you have \n\n--- Page 302 ---\n\n294\nChapter 11a list of fiction writers who are not only inter -\nested in more of your “How To Write Fiction” \ncontent, but may also be interested in reading \nyour own works of fiction as well.\n• Early/Exclusive Content:  Can you capture \nemail addresses as a storyteller? You bet. \nAllow readers to download the first chapter \nof your upcoming (not-yet-released) novel \nin advance. Or, allow readers to opt-in for \naccess to additional storylines and side \nplots of the main characters from your \nbooks. Whatever it is, just make sure it is \nspecific enough for the reader to imagine \nwhat they’re going to be receiving in return \nfor giving away their email address. Saying, \n“Subscribe for more of my writing!” isn’t \nenough.\n• Different Levels Of Audience:  As you \nlearn more and more about your readers, \nyou can (and should) create resources for \neach level of reader. For example, if you are \na digital marketer and you regularly write \nabout digital marketing strategies, all your \nreaders aren’t going to fit within the same \nbucket. You’re going to want to create one \nfree email course for beginners (“Getting \nStarted: 5 Days To Setting Up Your First \nProfitable Facebook Ad”), another free email \ncourse for advanced marketers (“30 Days, 30 \nExamples Of How To Maximize Facebook Ad \nRevenue And Convert 10x More Leads Into \nCustomers”), and another free email course \n\n--- Page 303 ---\n\n295\nChapter 11for experts (“7 Days To $1 Million: Facebook \nAd Strategies For Experts”).\n• Templates/Worksheets:  Readers love \nthings that are “plug and play.” For example, \nif you write about health and fitness, you \ncan allow readers to download a handful of \nspecialized workout routines. Or, if you’re \na memoir writer, you can give readers on \nyour website a template for them to write \na memoir of their own. Or, if you’re a leader -\nship coach, you can give readers a worksheet \nfor them to facilitate their own team-build -\ning exercises at work.\nFor example, one of the first opt-ins I ever created on my \nsite was an email course for people looking to build their \npersonal brand online.\nI had been writing about personal branding on Quora, \nas well as Inc Magazine , and those pieces always got a \nhigh level of engagement. People would email me asking \nhow I built my personal brand, and how they should get \nstarted building their own. So, I combined a handful of my \nmost popular articles into a 7-day email course titled, “7 \nSteps To Start Building Your Personal Brand,” and hosted it \non my website.\nData told me this was a resource my readers wanted—and \nthat email course has since captured tens of thousands of \nemail addresses.\n\n--- Page 304 ---\n\n296\nChapter 11Turning Articles/Pillar Pieces/Email \nCourses/Newsletters Into Products & \nServices\nYou’ve been writing online for 6-12 months…\nYou’ve learned what readers want to hear about from you \n(through data), and you’ve clarified your Content Buckets…\nYou’ve launched your own website, and written a handful \nof Pillar Pieces…\nYou’ve created a few even more relevant, even more valuable  \nresources for readers to opt-in and download…\nNow it’s time to sell them something.\nBut first, I want to pause.\nDo you see how linear this path is? Could you imagine how \nmany unanswered questions you would still have if you \nhad started out, day one , trying to write and sell a book, or \na product, or a course? Do you understand how acquiring \ndata about your readers seems like the longer road, but in \nreality, it’s actually a shortcut?\nOne of the most legendary copywriters in the world, and \na great friend and mentor of mine, Craig Clemens, summa -\nrizes this point perfectly. “People don’t buy products. They \nbuy solutions to urgent  problems.” Most writers who try \nto enter the game and write a book, or expect their first \narticle on the internet to be a viral sensation, think they \nknow what their target readers’ urgent problem is—but \nthey don’t. They are assuming. They are guessing. They \nhave zero proof that they clearly understand the intricacies \n\n--- Page 305 ---\n\n297\nChapter 11of the problem. And furthermore, they have not yet proven \nthat the market has determined them the best possible \nsource of information for that particular problem.\n(This is true for both fiction and nonfiction by the way.)\nAs a result, they put in all this hard work and effort, only \nto launch their book, or paid newsletter, or course, or \nwhatever, only for it to fall on deaf ears.\nThey didn’t know how to speak to their target reader.\nAs a result, their target reader didn’t listen.\nWhen you give 99% of your “best stuff” away for free, \nthat means you should only monetize the last 1%. And \nin that last 1% should be just as much, if not \nEVEN MORE value than the other 99%.\nI am not exaggerating when I say I have probably written \nmore than 1,000 articles on the internet just on the topic of \nwriting online.\nI have written about it on Quora and Medium. I have \ncreated Pillar Pieces and downloadable resources on my \nwebsite. I have spoken on podcasts. I have held workshops \nand presented at masterminds and conferences. Almost \nevery single piece of insight in this book, I have shared \nsomewhere else already for free.\nSo then why did you buy this book?\n• Convenience:  You didn’t want to go scroll -\ning through my library of 3,000+ articles to \nfind the ones about writing. Buying this book \nand having all those insights here was easier \n(I saved you time).\n\n--- Page 306 ---\n\n298\nChapter 11• Specificity:  You didn’t want to piece \ntogether handfuls of takeaways from all my \nfree content. You wanted an entire resource \ndedicated to one specific topic: how to write \nonline.\n• Depth:  You didn’t just want to read an 800-\nword article on the topic of online writing \nthat barely skimmed the surface. You wanted \n200+ pages, and you wanted examples, and \nyou wanted stories, and you wanted to feel \nlike if you went down this rabbit hole and \nmade it all the way through this book, you’d \nemerge 100x more knowledgeable and pre -\npared for success.\nIt’s the same reason Digital Press became a million-dollar \nbusiness in less than 10 months, and a multi-million-dollar \nbusiness in less than 2 years.\nI have written hundreds of articles on the internet about \npersonal branding, and how to position yourself on the \ninternet as a leader in your industry. The answers on how \nto do it are out there for anyone and everyone to use for \nthemselves. The problem is, founders of companies, C-level \nexecutives, investors, international speakers, those types of \npeople don’t have the time to learn and master those skills \nfor themselves—nor do they have the time or expertise to \neffectively share their thoughts and insights at scale on the \ninternet.\nSo what do they do?\nThey hire someone— specifically, someone who actively \nwrites about the very thing they want for themselves.\n\n--- Page 307 ---\n\n299\nChapter 11The best products and services are a reflection of your \nproven, high-performing topics.\nIf readers are devouring your written content about how \nto write a memoir, why not turn “Memoir Coaching” into \na business?\nIf readers are hooked on your short stories about what it’s \nlike working as a developer at Facebook, why not turn that \ninto a paid newsletter?\nIf readers are loving your opinion articles about brand \nmessaging, why not offer “Brand Messaging” as a service \nfor companies?\nThe art of online writing is all about letting readers tell \nyou what it is they want more of, and what they’re \nwilling to pay for.\nThen, once you’ve effectively captured and held their atten -\ntion, you can present them with the next most relevant, \nmost valuable  piece of content in your library.\nThis is how you (finally) make money as a writer.\n\n--- Page 308 ---\n\n300Chapter  12\nHow To Make Money Online \nAs A Writer\nThis is the question every aspiring writer asks first.\nWhich is why I’m answering it last.\nMaking money as a writer shouldn’t even be on your list of \npriorities until you’ve proven the following:\n• You can (and want to) write IN PUBLIC \non a regular basis.  1x per month is barely \ncutting it. 2x per month, OK. 4x per month, \nnow you’re getting somewhere. DAILY? Shoot \nme an email (cole@nicolascole.com), because \nI want to invest in YOU.\n• You have clearly defined your Content \nBuckets.  You know what your high-perform -\ning topics are. You know how to capture and \nkeep your target readers’ attention. You’ve \nlearned (through trial and error) what they \nlike, don’t like, and want more of.\n• You have launched your own website and \npositioned yourself in your niche.  You \nknow (through data) what your most valuable \ncontent is. You have planted your flag in the \nground and said, “This is who I am. This is \nwhat I write about. And if this is what you’re \nlooking for, you’ve come to the right place.”\n\n--- Page 309 ---\n\n301\nChapter 12If you’ve put in the work and gone through these steps, \nthen guess what?\nNow it’s time to make some money.\nThere are only 3 ways to monetize your writing: Ads, Pay -\nwalls, or Services.\nLet’s break them down.\nThe Advertising Model\nAKA: “The Attention Model.”\nThe first route to profitability as a writer is to generate \nenough “attention” for you to go out and sell that attention \nto someone (usually a company or brand) that wants to \nreach your target audience. For example, most YouTubers \nmake money by running relevant pre-roll ads on their \nvideos. Most Instagrammers make money by taking a pic -\nture with a product and promoting it to their followers. \nMost high-traffic bloggers make money by running Google \nAds on their website. All of these are different examples of \nthe same model: attention in exchange for dollars.\nThe problem, however, is that in order for this model to \ngenerate any money at all, you need a shit-ton of attention.\nFor example, when I wrote for Inc Magazine , I made \nmoney through the advertising model.\nAs a publication, Inc brings in about 20 million page views \nper month. All that “attention” is valuable, and can be sold \nto companies looking to target Inc’s readers (small business \nowners, entrepreneurs, managers, etc.). How Inc makes \n\n--- Page 310 ---\n\n302\nChapter 12money, as a business, is they go out and sell banner ads on \ntheir site to companies looking to target those same cus -\ntomer demographics—and then display those ads on the \narticles I (and every other columnist) write for the publi -\ncation. When someone reads one of my articles, Inc makes \nmoney, and in turn, I make money. (For context: I made \na penny per page view. So even with millions of views on \nmy work, I wasn’t exactly going yacht shopping.)\nWhile the advertising model might seem great, it has \na handful of flaws:\n1. People hate ads.  If you’ve ever tried read -\ning an article on Inc or Forbes  or any other \nmajor publication, you’ve experienced the \n10-second seizure your computer goes into \nbefore letting you scroll down the page. Then, \nas soon as you start to scroll, a Kia video ad \ntakes over your screen. This is bad for reader \nloyalty—and why social environments are \nmuch more beneficial for building audiences.\n2. People don’t trust dozens of different \nsponsorships.  If you see an Instagrammer \npromoting a different product every other \nweek, you’re going to eventually stop taking \nthem seriously. But in order to maintain \nconsistent revenue, you need to constantly be \npartnering with brands. Over time, because \nyou are promoting different products, people \nstart to see you as “fake.” This same logic \napplies to writers. If you are constantly pro -\nmoting different products in your articles or \nwriting, eventually readers are going to feel \n\n--- Page 311 ---\n\n303\nChapter 12like the attention they’re giving you is being \ntaken for granted.\n3. Ads require a ton of volume. Very few writ -\ners for major publications get paid, simply \nbecause they don’t bring in enough traffic \nto warrant adding them into the business’s \npayroll system (their monthly checks would \nbe the equivalent of a cup of coffee). In order \nto make any real money, whether you’re \na writer for a publication or you have your \nown website and are running your own ads \nvia Google, you need to be accumulating \nhundreds of thousands of page views every \nmonth to even break $1,000. And if $1,000 \nsounds like a lot of money to you, go write \n30+ articles in a month and track your hours. \nWhen all is said and done, you’re effectively \nearning well below minimum wage.\n4. Ads are volatile.  Some months writing for \nInc, I made $3,000. Other months, I made \n$400. When you are making money purely \noff “attention,” revenue goes up and down \nbased on performance—which makes it very \nhard to make forward-thinking decisions. \nIn fact, the biggest reason why I waited so \nlong to quit my 9-5 job (even though I was \nout-earning myself writing for Inc) was \nbecause my money was dependent upon me \ngoing viral. I didn’t feel comfortable giving \nup my full-time salary until I had months \nand months of data showing me what I could \nconsistently generate from a revenue per -\n\n--- Page 312 ---\n\n304\nChapter 12spective, on average.\nThe reason the advertising model is so popular, however, \nis because it’s also the easiest model for people to under -\nstand—which is why so many people pursue it.\nUnfortunately (or maybe fortunately), no social platform \nhas successfully monetized “attention” for writers the way \nYouTube monetizes attention for video creators. Medium \nwas trying to, but their model has since shifted to the “pay -\nwall” model.\nAs a result, many writers continue to write online with no \nreal awareness around how to turn page views into dollars.\nHere’s how you can monetize your writing with the adver -\ntising model:\nSell Ad Space Within Your Content\nThe same way major publications go out and sell ad \nspace to big brands and companies, you can do the same \nthing within your written content. A few years ago, when \nMedium was pushing their “publications” run by commu -\nnity members (anyone could start their own publication \nand recruit other writers on Medium to contribute pieces), \nthis was how nearly every single publication was mone -\ntized. Someone (like you or me) would start a publication \naround a topic (say Life Advice or Startup News), recruit \ndozens and dozens of writers to contribute pieces, and then \ngo out and sell sponsorships and ads within the articles \nthat appeared on that publication.\nYou can do the exact same thing as an independent writer.\n\n--- Page 313 ---\n\n305\nChapter 12If you have a big enough audience (minimum 5,000-10,000 \nfollowers), and you are attracting enough traffic (mini -\nmum 50,000 – 100,000 page views per month), you can \nreach out to brands looking to target the same audience \nas your readers, and see if they’d be willing to advertise \non a few of your posts. They’d essentially pay you to link \nto their site, or one of their resources, somewhere within \nthose pieces. Do note, however, many brands that do this \nalso request a pretty heavy-handed “sales pitch” for their \ncompany (and you need to educate them on why this is \na terrible idea), requiring you to write something like, \n“Which is why I recommend XYZ Company, the best-tasting, \nmost affordable product I’ve ever experienced!”\nWhen selling ad space, you’re either going to make money \nselling:\n1. Impressions: How many people “see” the \npost.\n2. Clicks: How many people click the link to \nthe brand’s website/resource/etc.\n3. Conversions: How many people see, then \nclick, then actually convert into a lead \n(email address) or customer (successful pur -\nchase) for the brand.\nIf this seems like a lot of work with a steep learning curve, \nthat’s because it is.\nYou’re now a full-time writer and ad-selling specialist.\n*Note: You can only do this on social platforms. \nOn major publications, as soon as a piece is \npublished, technically they “own it.” They also \n\n--- Page 314 ---\n\n306\nChapter 12have pretty strict clauses in their contracts \nthat say columnists cannot receive payment in \nexchange for mentioning or promoting another \ncompany, product, service, etc. \nLand A Brand Sponsorship\nA slightly easier way of executing the above is to just \npartner with one brand exclusively in some sort of formal \ncapacity.\nThis is extremely common in other industries—Michael \nJordan sponsored by Nike, for example—and yet it is \nalmost nonexistent in the world of publishing. Personally, \nI believe as more and more writers realize the power of \nsocial media, and are forced to build their own audiences, \nbrand sponsorships between companies and writers will \nbecome more common.\nHow writers monetize at the brand level today is by selling \nbanner ads somewhere on their website. A fitness writer \nwill let a supplement company “sponsor” their site for a \nmonth—putting their logo and some product shots on a \nheader on their site. Or a music blogger will let a music \nlabel “sponsor” their blog by putting pictures of their art -\nists’ albums and songs all over the place.\nBrand sponsorships typically last about a month, and then \nbased on the performance of the campaign (again: impres -\nsions, clicks, conversions), the brand will decide whether \nor not they want to continue sponsoring you and your \nsite. If your website is doing millions of page views, this \ncan be a lucrative path to monetization. But again, you \nare responsible for finding the brands. You’re responsible \n\n--- Page 315 ---\n\n307\nChapter 12for “selling” them on why their advertising dollars should \nbe spent sponsoring your site (for example: you have an \ninsane amount of traffic, or you have a hardcore, super-en -\ngaged reader base, etc.). And you’re responsible for all the \ninvoicing and accounting.  \nMy honest opinion here is, by the time you build a website \nbringing in millions of page views, you’re most likely going \nto learn there are far better (and much easier) ways to \nmake money as a writer.\nRun Google Ads On Your Site\nThe most common way writers (specifically bloggers) make \nmoney online is they build up traffic on their website and \nthen integrate Google Ads to make money “passively.”\nIndividual sites do this. Publications do this. The whole idea \nbehind Google Ads is to “turn them on” and then allow their \nadvertising network to run ads on your site that relate to \nyour audience. The pro here is that you don’t really have to \nmanage anything—you don’t have to go out and find the \nbrands willing to spend money on advertising, you don’t \nhave to negotiate any of the deals, etc. But the pro is also \nthe con. Since it’s all “plug and play,” you don’t have too \nmuch say over what ads appear on your site (they will be \nloosely related to your target readers though) and can very \nquickly make your site look like a cheap destination.\nPersonally, I am not a big fan of this path to profitability.\nThink of ads as a lever. In order to make more money, you \nneed to run more ads. But the more ads you run, the less \nspace on your site is actually dedicated to your writing—\nwhich destroys the quality of experience for your readers. \n\n--- Page 316 ---\n\n308\nChapter 12However, you need your readers to keep coming back in \norder to show them ads, in order to make more money.\nIt becomes a bit of a vicious cycle where you either decide \nyou don’t care at all about the reading experience to \nmaximize earnings, or you maintain a positive reading \nexperience but end up not making enough off ads to war -\nrant even running them in the first place.\nBecome An Affiliate\nAffiliate marketing is an extremely popular way of making \nmoney as a content writer.\nAll “affiliate marketing” means is that you make commis -\nsion on every sale you facilitate.  For example, if you have \na large audience of readers interested in direct response \nmarketing, you could become an affiliate for Clickfunnels \n(a company that sells software for direct response mar -\nketers). Then, every time you write a piece about direct \nresponse marketing, you could (elegantly) say in one of \nyour Main Points, “…and if you’re looking to build your own \nmarketing funnels, I recommend taking a look at a company \nlike Clickfunnels.”  You would sign up as an affiliate for \nClickfunnels, generate your own unique link, and direct \nreaders to their website via your link and make a commis -\nsion if they become a customer.\nAnother popular example of affiliate marketing is with \nAmazon.\nIf your audience is interested in mystery stories, you can \nbecome an affiliate with Amazon (anyone can sign up to \ndo this) and use your affiliate link every time you recom -\nmend a new mystery story to your readers. When they click \n\n--- Page 317 ---\n\n309\nChapter 12and buy the book on Amazon, you receive a commission. \nAs a best practice, most writers disclose to their audiences \nwho they are an affiliate for and why (“Full disclosure: \nThis is an affiliate link.”), but as long as you’re recom -\nmending relevant products to your audience, most readers \ndon’t mind.\nWhile this might sound like small potatoes, it’s worth \npointing out that affiliate marketing is a $7 billion-dollar \nindustry. I know writers who make six-figure incomes \npurely off (elegant) affiliate marketing woven into their \nwriting. But this is also a monetization path that is typi -\ncally better suited for digital marketers and content writers \nthan essayists, novelists, self-help writers, etc., although \nI have seen it executed in those categories as well.\nDone tastefully, affiliate marketing can be a great second \nor third revenue stream for you to add into your portfolio.\nDon’t Monetize Your Writing—Monetize  \n Your Personality\nThe last way you can (technically) monetize your writing \nis by leveraging other social platforms with advertising \nmodels.\nInstead of trying to make money off the attention of your \nwriting, you can direct that attention to your YouTube \nchannel, or your podcast, or your Instagram page, where \nyou talk about writing, or share tutorial videos  about writ -\ning, or post pictures  of you traveling the world as a writer, \netc. We are living in an age where sometimes the best path \nto making a living “doing what you love” is finding creative \nways to monetize not necessarily the craft itself, but all the \n\n--- Page 318 ---\n\n310\nChapter 12things that surround the craft: how you write, where you \nwrite, who you write with and learn from, your knowledge \nabout writing, etc.  You might discover you can make far \nmore money as a YouTuber making writing tutorials than \nyou ever could writing.  \nHowever, this usually requires you to “shift” your dream.\nFor many years, I fought myself on exploring these other \npaths of monetization. Some part of me felt like I was \n“giving up” on the dream of being a full-time, professional \nwriter and author if I made any money whatsoever doing \nanything except writing. What I ended up realizing is that \neven when you do start making money off your writing, \nyou’re still going to want to diversify your income streams. \nWhat happens when your best-selling book stops selling? \nWhat happens when your website traffic starts falling? \nWhat happens when you decide you want to pivot to a new \ngenre, or add a completely different “content bucket” into \nthe mix? Do you really want to go back to being a barista \n(or in my case, a copywriter at an advertising agency) and \nstart from ground zero all over again?\nMy recommendation is to explore anything and every -\nthing that advances your writing career forward, and can \n“double” as a marketing vehicle for your writing, allowing \nyou to add more revenue streams into the mix.\nAnd that means monetizing more than just your writing.\n\n--- Page 319 ---\n\n311\nChapter 12The Paywall Model\nAKA: “The Exclusivity Model.”\nThe second route to profitability as a writer is to charge for \naccess to your content.\nThe paywall model is essentially the opposite of the adver -\ntising model. Where the advertising model requires a \nmassive following in order to start monetizing, the pay -\nwall model can begin day one (although I still recommend \ngoing through the steps in this book, otherwise you’re \ngoing to make some pretty big assumptions about what \npeople are willing to pay for).\nFor example, the first money I made “as a writer” was by \nselling my fitness eBook series on my website in 2015.\nWhile my answer to the Quora question, “Is it possible to \nchange so much you no longer recognize yourself?” was \ngoing viral, I realized I could monetize the attention I was \ncapturing by selling “access” to a more valuable, more rel -\nevant resource . Instead of going out and trying to sell that \nattention to a brand or company, I decided to monetize it \nmyself by creating my own product and putting it up for \nsale. The 1 million views I accumulated on Quora made me \n$0 through the advertising model (because Quora doesn’t \nreward writers with money in exchange for viewership), \nbut made me thousands of dollars through the exclusivity \nmodel (charging for access to the eBook on my website). \nI added a link to my two eBooks inside the post, and \na percentage of readers (who wanted to know my workout \nroutines and meal plan) clicked and bought my products.\nNow, you do need some sort of “attention” in order to \n\n--- Page 320 ---\n\n312\nChapter 12monetize “exclusive” content—however the barrier to entry \nis much, much lower. With the advertising model, you \nneed hundreds of thousands of page views in order to even \nmake a few hundred bucks per month. But with 1,000 \nloyal fans and readers, you can start generating serious \nrevenue through the paywall model. I highly recommend \nreading the essay “1,000 True Fans” by Kevin Kelly, where \nhe explains how you really don’t need millions of readers \nin order to make an amazing living as a writer. Instead, if \nyou can get 1,000 true fans (who spend at least $100 per \nyear buying and supporting everything you put out into \nthe world), you can earn yourself $100,000 per year.\nThat is a completely attainable and realistic goal for any \nwriter.\nI much prefer the “exclusivity” model to the “attention” \nmodel, but here are a few of the challenges that come with \nmonetizing access:\n1. You still need to build “attention” in \norder to start monetizing.  It doesn’t need \nto be a massive audience, but it needs to be \nan audience nonetheless. So while a lot of \nwriters want to skip to the part in the story \nwhere they launch a $20 book and start \ncashing checks, the truth is, you still need to \ngo through the steps. You still need to gather \ndata from your readers. You still need to nail \ndown your Content Buckets. You still need \nto successfully move them from free social \nenvironments over to your website. And you \nstill need to gain clarity around what prob -\nlem you’re actually solving—and what your \n\n--- Page 321 ---\n\n313\nChapter 12target readers will be willing to pay for. The \nonly difference here is that you can begin \nthis process with a niche audience of 1,000 \nfollowers.\n2. Your “exclusive” content needs to be even \nbetter than your free content.  Making \nreally great free content is hard (much harder \nthan people realize). But making paid content \nis even harder—and yet, most writers have \nthem flipped. They think anyone can write \nfree content on the internet, and the only \nrespectable form of writing is the kind you \nget paid for. I wholeheartedly disagree. If you \ncan’t write free things on the internet that \ncapture and keep people’s attention, chances \nare, you aren’t ready to release a paid project. \nOf course, there are the success stories (one \nin a billion) that prove otherwise, but I don’t \nfind “playing the lottery” to be a very strate -\ngic life decision.\n3. Paid content requires a higher level of \nattention to detail.  The advertising model \nhas caused massive issues within our society \n(a topic for another time), primarily because \nit encourages the wrong behavior. It’s a \nmodel that rewards quantity over quality, \nand where “visibility” tends to trump “abil -\nity.” As a result, creators just sort of “spray \nand pray.” They pump out as much content as \npossible with the hopes of capturing eyeballs \nand increasing ad revenue. Paid content, on \nthe other hand, incentivizes loyalty. If you \n\n--- Page 322 ---\n\n314\nChapter 12are paying for access to something—espe -\ncially on any sort of month-to-month \nbasis—you have very high expectations as \na consumer. You expect good quality. You \nexpect a positive experience. You expect the \nproduct to be delivered on time, in a profes -\nsional manner. There is more “at stake.” As \na result, writers who successfully monetize \nwith paid content tend to make far more \nmoney—but also have to spend far more \ntime creating products people love buying \nagain and again.\nMy personal belief is that the “exclusivity” model is the \nfuture for writers in the digital age. We are moving into \na world where, because of the internet, we don’t need to \nbe heard by millions of people in order to make an impact. \nInstead, we can create and discover niche communities \nthat are hyper-specific to our interests—and in some cases, \nwe’re even willing to pay for access.\nHere’s how you can monetize your writing with the exclu -\nsivity model:\nWrite Behind A Paywall\nMore and more websites today are forgoing the advertising \nmodel to build subscription revenue instead.\nIf you’ve noticed, publications like the New York Times, \nWall Street Journal , etc., have started putting their content \nbehind a paywall. They might give you three free articles as  \na taste of what you can expect, but after those three articles \nyou’re required to pay in order to keep reading. Sites like \n\n--- Page 323 ---\n\n315\nChapter 12Medium and Wattpad are also exploring this model, requir -\ning readers to pay per month for access to their content, and \nthen compensating writers for regularly publishing exclusive \ncontent for the site to monetize in the first place.\nAs a writer, part of making money off your craft means \nconstantly keeping your finger on the pulse of what new \nplatforms are emerging for you to leverage (and if you \nwant to be the first to know what those opportunities are, \nthen I highly recommend subscribing to my paid newslet -\nter—SEE HOW THIS WORKS????).\nFor example, Wattpad recently launched Paid Stories. The \nway they describe it on their website, “Wattpad Paid Sto -\nries is our response to readers who want the opportunity \nto show support for the writers they love. Writers can now \nearn money for their work on Wattpad from readers who \nappreciate it.” How it works is readers buy “coins” within \nthe platform/app, and then use those coins to unlock chap -\nters or entire stories from their favorite writers.\nWhen I first found out about Wattpad’s Paid Stories though, \nI realized this feature was only available for the highest \nperforming writers on the platform. Which meant, in order \nfor me to use this mechanism to monetize my own writing, \nI would need to publish a ton of free content on Wattpad \n(and stick with it for at least six months, to learn through \ndata whether or not Wattpad’s audience actually found \nmy writing valuable) to build myself up on the platform. If \nI invested a year or two, maybe I could unlock this feature \nfor myself as well.\nDoes that mean other writers shouldn’t try to monetize on \nWattpad?\n\n--- Page 324 ---\n\n316\nChapter 12Not at all.\nBut knowing what would be required in order to make it \nfinancially successful is an important piece of the puzzle.\nCreate A Product\nIt took me a very long time as a writer to realize when \nyou’re writing a book you ultimately want to sell, you’re \ndoing much more than just writing .\nYou’re trying to sell a product.\nWhen a customer looks at a $15 package of words, what \ndrives their decision to purchase is not the fact that you took \nthe time to write the thing in the first place. What drives \ntheir purchase is what they believe your words can do for \nthem . Sometimes, readers buy books because they speak to \ntheir wants, needs, and desires . Other times, readers buy \nbooks because of what the author stands for, or the contro -\nversy surrounding their story. And every once in a while, \nreaders buy books because of the cover, which they believe \nwill add a great accent color to their coffee table.\nRegardless, the customer  is buying a product .\nNow, writing a book is one way to make money as a \nwriter—but if you notice, it’s one of many. A product could \nalso be a workbook, a calendar, a coffee mug, a leath -\ner-bound journal, a t-shirt, a candle, or a deck of cards \nwith inspirational phrases from timeless writers. Ryan Hol -\niday, best-selling author of “The Obstacle Is The Way” and \n“The Daily Stoic” is a great example. After “The Daily Stoic” \nbecame a best-selling book, he realized (through data) his \nreaders wanted more information about stoicism. So he \n\n--- Page 325 ---\n\n317\nChapter 12launched dailystoic.com, where he now sells memento \nmori medallions, rings, pendants, “The Daily Stoic Chal -\nlenge” deck of cards, and even a 5.5’’ hand-sculpted pewter \nportrait of Marcus Aurelius.\nSell A Course\nWhile writing a book might seem like the most “literary” \nway to make money, it’s usually not the fastest (or most \nprofitable) path to earning a living as a writer. For context, \nin order to make $1 million dollars as a writer, you need \n100,000 people to buy your $10 book.\nOr, you need 5,000 people to buy a $200 course.\nThese are different paths, requiring different skill sets, \nhowever there’s no reason why they can’t work in concert \nwith each other to provide you (the writer) with more \nfinancial upside and long-term security.\nJames Clear, the author of “Atomic Habits,” one of the \nbest-selling self-help books of the past few years, is a perfect \nexample. On his website he has a $299 video course called \n“The Habits Academy,” which is him, sitting in front of his \nbookshelf, essentially walking listeners through the same \ninformation that’s already in his book—just in video form. \nSo, why have thousands of people signed up and purchased \nthis course? Maybe because they don’t like reading, but love \nwatching videos. Or maybe they are huge fans of James Clear \nand want as much access to him and his knowledge as they \ncan get (remember: 1,000 true fans). Or maybe it’s because \nthe video course offers a bit more structure and account -\nability—and if someone is struggling to build positive habits, \nthey’re willing to make a $299 investment in themselves.\n\n--- Page 326 ---\n\n318\nChapter 12The reason why Clear and other best-selling authors are \nnow launching courses is because even they know how dif -\nficult it can be to earn a great living purely off book sales. \nMark Manson, author of the best-selling book, “The Subtle \nArt of Not Giving A F*ck,” is another example. He sells six \ndifferent life advice courses on his site.\nWhen you launch a course, your readers then become more \nthan just fans of your books.\nThey become leads for you to convert into higher-ticket \ncustomers.\nStart A Paid Newsletter\nThis is my new favorite way to monetize as a writer.\nThink of paid newsletters as micro-paywalls. Instead of \nbuilding yourself up on a platform with a paywall like \nMedium or Wattpad, you can start a paid newsletter on \nSubstack and start monetizing your “exclusive content” \nthere instead.\nThe reason why I believe paid newsletters are going to \nbe the future for writers is because they provide monthly \nsubscription revenue. For example, I have no idea how \nmuch I’m going to earn every month on Medium. It’s the \nsame problem I had when writing for Inc, where my earn -\nings were tied to performance. When one of my articles \ngoes viral, I make great money. When I go a month or two \nwithout a viral hit, my income drops.\nThe difference with paid newsletters is that readers have \nto subscribe on a monthly basis. This gives you (the writer) \nmore stability and reassurance that your income isn’t going \n\n--- Page 327 ---\n\n319\nChapter 12to just magically disappear 30 days from now. You can \nalso begin monetizing with this path much faster than \nyou could building yourself up on a platform like Medium. \n1,000 true fans at $10 per month is $10,000 every 30 days. \nThat’s a six-figure income by serving a very small, very \nniche, very loyal audience.\nDon’t make it more complicated than it is: a paid newslet -\nter is nothing more than an even more relevant, even more \nvaluable  part of your library. For example, you could take \nyour book-in-progress and publish it chapter by chapter as \na weekly paid newsletter instead of publishing it the con -\nventional way—and probably make more money.\nWho says a book needs to be “a book” anymore?\nHost A Workshop/Event\nLastly, you can hold a workshop, event, panel, curated dis -\ncussion, or “class,” where you share additional information \nwith your tight-knit community.\nThink of this as a more meaningful way for you to engage \nwith your audience, fans, followers, and readers. It’s one \nthing to read someone’s insights online, or in a book, or \neven hear it from them in a pre-recorded video course. But \nit’s a very different experience getting to be in the same \nroom as that person, or connect with them live in a virtual \nsetting.\nWhen curating an event, just think about what additional \nvalue you can provide your readers. If you’re a fiction \nwriter, host a fiction writing workshop, or an event \nwhere readers can help you brainstorm storylines for \nthe characters in your next book. If you’re a non-fiction \n\n--- Page 328 ---\n\n320\nChapter 12writer, consider creating an online class where you help \nother writers learn how to outline, title, and self-publish \na memoir. If you’re a copywriter, put together a panel of \ncopywriters who have generated tens of millions, even \nbillions of dollars in sales, and make it an exclusive \nexperience for ten aspiring copywriters, $250 per seat. \nIf you’re a blogger, put together a mastermind group that \nmeets once per month to share strategies for increasing \nwebsite traffic.\nPersonally, I love hosting virtual workshops—and I do \noften with writers who are subscribed to my newsletter. \nWhen I studied fiction writing in college, the focal point of \nthe program was to bring your writing to class that week \nand read it aloud to the semi-circle of twelve or so students \nsitting around you. I quickly realized how fast I was grow -\ning as a writer by having to say my words out loud, forcing \nme to hear unnecessary words or sections that dragged \non and on. When I started Digital Press, I used this same \nworkshop technique with every single writer and editor we \nhired, reading client pieces aloud over Zoom and asking \nthe group, “What did you notice? What stands out to you \nin this section?”\nBeing able to facilitate these types of experiences is a skill \nin itself—and one you can certainly charge for.\nThe Services Model\nAKA: “The “I’ll-Do-It-For-You Model.”\nThe third and final route to profitability as a writer is to do \nfor others what you’ve already (successfully) done for your -\nself.\n\n--- Page 329 ---\n\n321\nChapter 12If you know how to write viral content, people will pay you \nto write viral content for them.\nIf you know how to write thoughtful, articulate opin -\nion columns, people will pay you to write thoughtful, \narticulate opinion columns for them.\nIf you know how to write high-performing email courses, \nPDF guides, whitepapers, etc., companies and solopreneurs \nwill pay you to create those same assets for their company.\nIf you know how to write (and market) a book to #1 on \nAmazon, people will pay you to help them write (and \nmarket) a #1 best-selling book on Amazon.\nBasically, anything you know how to do, with an end result \nthat other people want as well,  can be sold as a service.\nUnfortunately, most writers aren’t aware of the value of \ntheir own skills. To be honest, most people in life don’t \nknow the value of their own skills. We all exist in our \nown little bubble, and get so used to the things we do \nand know, that we don’t even stop to consider how these \nskills or insights could be valuable for someone else. Since \nit’s “common knowledge” to us, we assume it’s “common \nknowledge” to everyone else—when that couldn’t be fur -\nther from the truth.\nHere’s how you can monetize your writing with the ser -\nvices model:\nContent Writing\nThe term “content writing” is all encompassing.\nCompanies need content. Founders and business owners \n\n--- Page 330 ---\n\n322\nChapter 12and entrepreneurs need content. Influencers need content. \nCelebrities need content. Authors need content. Investors \nneed content. Websites need content. Universities need \ncontent.\nThe list goes on and on.\nThe internet is nothing more than one massive library of \ncontent. In order for us to communicate with each other, \nwe need things to read, watch, listen to, consume, and \nshare. That means essentially every single entity with a \npresence on the internet, in some sort of capacity, needs \ncontent—and if you can provide the words they need, then \nyou’re in demand.\nThat said, the biggest mistake “content writers” make, as \nwell as the companies who hire them, is thinking their job \nis to write words. And it’s not.\nMost content writing jobs hyper-focus on word count. “We \nneed several 500-word blog posts,” or, “We need a 3,000-\nword Whitepaper.” But all words are not created equally. \nHere, let me show you.\nExample 1:  Most content writing jobs \nhyper-focus on word count.\nExample 2:  Giraffes eat purple but sunshine is \nthe reason.\nBoth these sentences have eight words. Are they both valu -\nable to you, the reader?\nNo.\n\n--- Page 331 ---\n\n323\nChapter 12Writers who price their value based on the number of \nwords they write are 1) implicitly saying “all writers are \ncreated equal so just find the cheapest option,” and 2) are \nworking toward the wrong goal. The goal is not to write a \n500-word blog post, or a 3,000-word Whitepaper.  \nThe goal is to write something that is even more valuable, \nand even more relevant  to the target reader—and success -\nfully encourages them to take some form of action (sign up \nfor a newsletter, purchase a product, etc.).\nIf you can deliver this sort of result, you will have no prob -\nlem earning a living as a writer.\nGhostwriting & Speechwriting\nThink of ghostwriting as luxury content writing.\nIf content writing is primarily for companies, then ghost -\nwriting is for the people who run and represent those \ncompanies (and/or any other public personality).\nI fell into the world of executive ghostwriting when I was \n26 years old. No one told me this industry existed. None \nof my teachers in college ever mentioned it as an option. \nWhat happened was, a very successful entrepreneur who \nhad previously sold his company for north of a billion \ndollars, sent me an email. He was an avid reader of my Inc \nMagazine  column, and was wondering if I would be willing \nto help him share his stories and insights as an entrepre -\nneur as well.\nOne client turned to two.\nTwo turned to four.\n\n--- Page 332 ---\n\n324\nChapter 12And a year later, Digital Press employed more than a dozen \nwriters and editors, and we had more than 50 clients all \naround the world.\nNow, there are some stigmas that surround the world \nof ghostwriting. Some people refuse to let someone else \n“write” for them—which is fine, they aren’t your ideal \nclient. And many writers refuse to lend their pen to some -\none else. Personally, I don’t see ghostwriting this way. I see \nit much closer to co-writing, in the sense that I could be \nthe most talented writer on the planet, but I don’t have the \ninsights, the stories, or the palette of colors to write what -\never is being shared with me in conversation from someone \nmuch more experienced and further along in their career.\nIt might be my pen, but it’s unquestionably their thoughts, \nideas, and perspectives.\nThe reason ghostwriting is such a viable path for writers \nis because, for one, you essentially get paid to build an \nimmensely valuable network. Second, ghostwriting is far \nmore lucrative than conventional content marketing. You \nhave to remember, you aren’t selling “words on a page.” \nWhat you’re selling is clarity of a message—and so how \nmuch is it worth, to that particular person, for them to \ncommunicate clearly?\nThird, ghostwriting requires you to learn how to write in \na wide variety of voices. Writing for a male executive is \ndifferent than writing for a female executive. Writing from \nan investor’s point of view is different than writing for \na founder. Writing for a musician is different than writ -\ning for a professional athlete is different than writing for \na politician. \n\n--- Page 333 ---\n\n325\nChapter 12Being able to learn how to weave in and out of all these \ndifferent types of voices will only make your own writing \nbetter.\nCopywriting\nMost people don’t actually know what the term “copywrit -\ning” means.\nCasually, people use the term to imply just about any sort \nof business writing: website copy, landing page copy, email \ncopy, ad copy, etc. But the truth is, the art of copywriting \ngoes so much deeper than that. I’ve spent time around \nsome of the most financially successful copywriters in the \nworld, and I can tell you they spend as much time obsess -\ning over which words will trigger the right emotions in \ntheir target readers as Dostoevsky probably spent refining \nCrime & Punishment.\nCopywriting is a very unique skill—and one that requires \na considerable amount of time to master.\nHowever, the reason why I consider it such a viable and \nworthwhile career path for writers (regardless of whether \nyour dream is to become a full-time fiction novelist or \na best-selling self-help author), is because copywriting \nteaches you how to sell. Whether we realize it or not, we \nas writers are “selling” readers our ideas. This entire book \nis dedicated to “selling” you on the idea that you should \nwrite online. When you read Harry Potter , J.K. Rowling is \n“selling” you on Hogwarts and Quidditch and all the things \nthat make Harry’s world real. When you read anything, \nyou are being sold an idea—and depending on how much \nthose ideas resonate with you determines whether or not \n\n--- Page 334 ---\n\n326\nChapter 12you continue reading, as well as whether or not you decide \nto tell five of your friends what you’ve just read.\nCopywriting is arguably the most lucrative career path \nfor writers, specifically because top-notch copywriters get \npaid to drive a financial result—of which they reap part of \nthe upside. For example, it’s common for world-class sales \ncopywriters to get paid six figures to write a single sales \nletter. And if that sales letter can successfully convert leads \ninto profitable customers, the copywriter can share in the \nprofit (usually amounting to hundreds of thousands, if not \nmillions of dollars).\nCompany Messaging, Consulting & \nAdvising\n“Messaging” is writing at the corporate level.\nWhen you get good enough at understanding how words \ncan shape people’s perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and \nreasons for action, you become much more than just \na writer.\nCompanies all over the world are constantly asking them -\nselves, “How can we better communicate who we are?  \nHow can we speak to our customers in a way that’s different \nfrom the competition? How can we educate the world on \nthis new problem we’re looking to solve?” Very few writ -\ners realize they can utilize their linguistic talents in this \ndomain—and it’s a shame, because it pays exceedingly well.\nThis typically ends up falling under the umbrella of “con -\nsulting and advising.” \n\n--- Page 335 ---\n\n327\nChapter 12At the end of the day, people will always pay for exper -\ntise. The writing, publishing, and media landscape has so \nmany different avenues that if you can master any single \npath, you will become an incredibly valuable source of \ninformation for anyone headed in that direction. If you’ve \nmastered the art of keyword hacking on Amazon, you can \nposition yourself as the go-to resource for that informa -\ntion. If you’ve mastered the art of writing high-performing \nFacebook ads, you can build an entire business around \ndoing nothing except writing Facebook ads for companies. \nIf you’ve mastered self-publishing niche fiction, you can \nconsult major publishing houses on how to get with the \ntimes and bring more readers to their own fiction authors. \nIf you’ve mastered writing pitch decks that allow compa -\nnies to raise millions of dollars in funding, you can get \npaid to tell startups what changes they need to make in \ntheir messaging to attract the attention of investors.  \nThe more time you invest in your skills as a writer, and \nthe more you continue to expand your portfolio of revenue \nstreams by combining any of the above, the more money \nyou will make—and more importantly, the more time you \nwill have to reinvest in the writing you enjoy doing the \nmost.\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you want to become a successful, professional writer \ntoday, you have to become more than just a writer.\nYou have to also be an entrepreneur.\nThe pipedream that a publishing house is just going to \nswoop in, save the day, and bring you tea and crumpets all \n\n--- Page 336 ---\n\n328\nChapter 12afternoon while you stare out the window working on the \nnext great American novel is dead.

They are brands. They \nare solo-run companies. They are the publisher, the cre -\native director, the distributor, and the writer, all wrapped \nup into one—and they embrace the additional responsibil -\nity, because it means they have more monetary ownership \nand creative control over their work.\nInstead of shying away from this new world, and wishing \nthings were different, I encourage you to welcome it with \nopen arms.\nEither way, this is the direction the publishing world is \nheaded.\nSo as my 8th grade math teacher used to say, “You can \neither get on the bus, or you can get off of the bus. Either \nway, we’re leaving.”\n\n--- Page 337 ---\n\n329Chapter  13\nThe 1 Habit Every Single \nWriter Needs To Master In \nOrder To Become Successful\nMost people who read this book aren’t going to implement \nany of the information shared here (hopefully you’re not \none of them).\nAnd the reason is because, the real issue , the “root of the \nroot” that keeps talented writers from ever making their \ndream come true has nothing to do with writing.\nIt has to do with discipline.\nIt has to do with self-belief.\nIt has to do with understanding the path of mastery.\nI know for a fact that everything I’ve shared with you \nin this book works. I know because I’ve lived it. I know \nbecause in order to test my theories, I’ve taken these \nformulas to my closest friends and encouraged them to \nexecute—and they have achieved similar results. I know \nbecause those friends all accumulated hundreds of thou -\nsands, millions, even tens of millions of views on their \nwork, had pieces republished in major publications, and \nhad some sort of “event” happen as a result of their writing \n(invited to speak on a podcast, connected with someone \nthey wanted to connect with, leveled-up their professional \n\n--- Page 338 ---\n\n330\nChapter 13perception, etc.). I know because I then built a company \naround my formulas, and worked with more than 300 \ndifferent entrepreneurs, executives, investors, speakers, \nGrammy-winning musicians, Olympic athletes, and NYT \nbest-selling authors—publishing thousands of articles, \naccumulating millions of views, building social follow -\nings, launching books and other products, and consulting \nfor some of the largest, most successful companies in the \nworld.\nAll of these outcomes came as a result of one very clear, \nvery simple habit.\nWriting—a lot.\nOne of the most common questions I get asked from writ -\ners is, “How do I get views on my articles? How do I get \npublished?” There’s a sort of entitlement in their voice \nas they say it: “I deserve  to be read. I deserve  to be a pub -\nlished, financially successful author—so tell me, how does \nit happen?” What they fail to realize, however, is that none \nof their actions, none of their habits, none of their efforts \nwarrant the outcome they desire for themselves and their \nwriting. They treat it as a hobby. They do it on the week -\nends. They don’t invest any time in learning how to market \nthemselves as a writer, or the business of writing, and they \ndon’t sit down, day after day after day, and just write .\nInstead, they think about writing—and hope that’ll be \nenough.\nAll growing up, my dad used to wear this raggy old \nno-sleeved shirt whenever he would lift weights in the \nbasement. On the back was a silhouette of a basketball \nplayer, and over it was a long paragraph. In that paragraph, \n\n--- Page 339 ---\n\n331\nChapter 13it said something to the effect of, “Somewhere, someone \nelse is practicing harder than you, faster than you, longer \nthan you. They want it more than you. And when you meet \nthem, they will win”—with the Nike swoosh as the period \nat the end.\nWriting online is a game. Publishing, and becoming \na best-selling author, is a game. Content writing is a game. \nGhostwriting is a game. Consulting and advising compa -\nnies on their messaging, and writing a fiction series that \nbecomes a movie that then becomes a line of action figures \nco-owned by Disney, these are all games.\nAnyone can play the game. And anyone can master the \ngame.\nThe question is, do your habits reflect your desires?\nDo you truly deserve to win?\n\n--- Page 340 ---\n\n332Nicolas Cole  is an author, viral writer & ghostwriter, and \nfounder of Digital Press and Different Publishing.\nHe is best known for his conversational style of writing and \nhas accumulated more than 100 million views to date.\nCole rose to internet stardom in 2015 when he became \nthe #1 most-read writer on Quora, accumulating tens of \nmillions of views on his viral articles about personal devel -\nopment.

I was 17 years old, \na junior in high school, and one of the top World of War -\ncraft players in North America. Long gone were the days of \nthe internet only being used by forward-thinking entrepre -\nneurs and computer scientists. The social digital revolution \nhad begun: Facebook was three years old, YouTube was \ntwo, and Twitter was a newborn wailing at the top of \nits lungs. \nRight before school let out for the summer, this new \nwebsite emerged in the competitive gaming community, \ncalled GameRiot. It was a “social media” site for gamers—\nbefore the term “social media” had even become part of \nthe world’s vocabulary. I’d heard about the site from a \ngaming blogger I loved reading. Every morning before \nschool, I would wake up, make myself two eggs on toast \n(wheat), and read his latest blog. He was one of the few \ntop-tier gamers who actually had his own website, so when \nhe made a post one morning saying he was going to start \nwriting somewhere else instead, I knew to pay attention.\nWhile the rest of my family played in the pool in the back -\nyard, I was upstairs in my bedroom. With freezing cold air \nblasting out of the air conditioner above my head, I sat at \nmy desk hunched over my keyboard with my face three \ninches from my monitor, exploring GameRiot. "

You could browse \nother people’s posts on the front page. You could scroll \nthrough different topics. You could comment, and other \npeople could comment back to you. The whole website was \na game, no different to me than the World of Warcraft—\nand without thinking twice about it, I decided I was going \nto start writing there too."

At first, I tried to make my \nblog the go-to resource for high-level gameplay informa -\ntion, breaking down team compositions, winning strategies, \nand little tricks to give gamers a competitive edge. But over \ntime, I started to realize it wasn’t the informative stuff that \nmade the front page—it was drama. \nGamers loved knowing which teams had rivalries with \nwho, which players had lost their shit after a loss, and who \nhad been sneaky enough to capture an audio recording of \nthe outburst for the entire World of Warcraft community to \nhear. More importantly, they wanted to know what some of \nthe best players were like in real life.\nIt didn’t take me long to realize that readers didn’t just \nwant to learn how to be better gamers themselves. \nThey also wanted to be entertained.\nWatching Ming execute this strategy perfectly, I began \nto mirror my writing style off his. Every one of his posts \nwas a blend between informative content and controver -\nsy-inducing tangents. In one single paragraph, he would \ngo from explaining the inner workings of the Rogue class \nto venting about how his Asian parents had arranged his \nupcoming marriage and the whole event was getting in \nthe way of his 3v3 team making it to BlizzCon’s first ever \nArena World Championship Tournament. The comment \nsection of his posts would explode with gamers either \ncuriously wanting to know more about his love life, or rid -\niculing him for thinking the World of Warcraft was more \nimportant than his wedding day.

They think the best path forward is to begin \na “web log.”\nThe truth is, blogging, having your own website, and writ -\ning online are three completely different things.

Your blog should become \nan industry publication, where the purpose of that publica -\ntion is to tap into search traffic around specific keywords \nand increase the likelihood of a reader becoming a cus -\ntomer looking to buy your product or service.\nThe second scenario  for starting a blog is the solopreneur, \nthe digital marketer, the fitness coach, the individual who \nis less concerned with sharing his or her own individual \ninsights and perspectives, and instead wants to use writ -\ning as a marketing mechanism for their internet business. \nThese types of websites aren’t really about the individ -\nual as much as they are the topic (and product) they are \nlooking to sell. Sure, some of the best travel or nutrition or \nfitness bloggers end up sharing a good amount about their \nown lives in the process, but their blog content is primarily \nfocused on providing informative answers to popular ques -\ntions directly related to their product or service.\nOne of the best examples I’ve ever seen is a website called \nKindlepreneur. This is an entire website dedicated to \neducating self-published authors on how to optimize and \nmaximize their self-publishing efforts. It’s an absolute \nbehemoth of a website, insanely informative, and con -\nstructed in a way where if you are the target audience, you \ncan’t help but find your way to the site, devour the free \nblog content, type your email into one of the many opt-in \nforms for more detailed information, and even purchase \none of the products (I did)."

Without ads, you might have seen 20 \npotential pieces of content in the three minutes you spent \nscrolling. But with ads, you might only see 15 pieces of \ncontent, with 5 ads sprinkled in. Well, where did the other \n5 pieces of content go?

We would all set Google \nAlerts for companies and public figures that aligned with our \nrespective columns, and we’d wait for them to be mentioned \nin the news. For example, in 2017, Mark Zuckerberg said in \nan interview that he was changing Facebook’s mission. The \ncompany’s previous mission, “To give people the power to \nshare and make the world more open and connected,” was \nunder fire after playing a controversial role in the 2016 presi -\ndential election. In this particular interview, Zuckerberg said \nFacebook was planning to double down on Facebook Groups, \nand its mission had evolved to, “Giving people the power to \nbuild community and bring the world closer together.”\nKnowing Facebook was all over the news, and knowing Inc \nMagazine  wanted to jack the trend, I wrote a piece titled, \nMark Zuckerberg Just Changed Facebook’s Mission—Here It \nIs In 1 Sentence."

If you write about life lessons, go look for \nother popular writers who also write about life lessons. If \nyou write mystery stories, go find other writers who write \nmystery stories. Once you have a list of ten or fifteen writ -\ners (ideally with audiences similar and slightly larger than \nyour own), go to each of their profiles and start comment -\ning on recent content they’ve published—or, even better, \nrespond to someone else’s comment on their content. For \nexample, if one writer’s most recent post was on life les -\nsons you should learn before you turn 30 years old, and \nsomeone commented, “I would add a few more to this list,” \nrespond back to them and piggy-back on their list to add \na few more suggestions of your own.\nThe whole idea here is to get your name in front of the \nsame people who are actively looking for the type of \ncontent you write. When that audience member sees you \nresponded to their comment, they’re going to read it. \nWhen they read it, and if it’s something more thoughtful \nthan just, “Nice one!” they’re going to go to your profile.

It’s a way of organiz -\ning content that is “tagged” the same thing. When you place \na hashtag on a social media post, all you’re doing is saying, \n“This piece of content should be organized in this folder.”\nThe biggest mistake people make when using hashtags is \ntreating them as words and phrases within their actual \nmessage. For example, they might post on Facebook: “I just \nwrote this piece. I hope you enjoy it! #myfirstposteveromg \n#2020\nThe hashtag #2020 works, because that’s a hashtag a lot of \nother people use to organize their content. But the hashtag \n#myfirstposteveromg isn’t a folder people are using—and \nif it is, it’s not specific enough to warrant someone using \nit to search for the content they’re trying to find. Which \nmeans that hashtag doesn’t actually do anything for your \ndistribution efforts. \nIf you are writing or sharing links to your writing on plat -\nforms that use hashtags, the correct way to do hashtag \nstacking is to do a little research before you post—so you \ncan tag your content with popular, relevant folders.

For example, one writer might tag all of their posts \n#writingadvice, because if you’re searching for writing \nadvice on a social platform, this is a good folder to start \nscrolling through. By tagging your posts with that same \nhashtag, all you’re doing is telling the platform to organize \nthis specific post within that folder.\nThis is step one.\nThe second step is to then create different tiers of folders \nfor your posts to be organized within. When you click on \na hashtag on any social platform, you can see how many \npeople are currently using that hashtag. What you want \nto do is tag your posts with a blend of both large, popular \nhashtags and smaller, niche hashtags. For example, #writ -\ning is typically a very large folder because it’s so broad. A lot \nof different types of content could be tagged #writing—\nwhich means even though you’ll be tapping into a wider \nnet of people, you’ll also be reaching a more generalized \naudience. But #businesswriting or #fictionwriting are more \nspecific. They’re smaller, in the sense that they’re niches \nand not broad, all-encompassing categories, which means \nthe audiences you’ll be tapping into are slightly smaller but \npotentially more relevant.\nThe reason I like tagging posts with both broad and niche \nhashtags is because it gives each post a chance to be \nexposed to the masses, and to be found by highly targeted \nreaders.

But in order to understand the best way of doing this, \nlet me clarify the difference between “publishing” and \n“sharing.”\nPublishing is the first time you are putting a specific piece \nof content on one specific platform. Most websites put \nthis in their terms of service, and will eventually flag you \nfor publishing the same content over and over again. For \nexample, on Quora you can’t copy/paste the same answer \nto dozens and dozens of different questions. On Medium, \nyou can’t publish the same article more than once. Even \non most websites and major publications, you can’t have \nthe same article appear in multiple places unless the \npublication facilitates this on your behalf (which is called \n“syndicating”). So, when in doubt, you’ll only want to \npublish a piece of content once per platform—including on \nyour own website.\nSharing, on the other hand, is the act of taking the link to \nthe original post and recirculating it across various social \nplatforms.\nThis is what so many companies don’t seem to understand \nabout social media marketing, and the incredible return \non investment (ROI) that comes with writing online. The \nbigger you build your library of content, especially when \nyour content is more timeless than timely , the more you \ncan continue to engage your audience well into the future. "

      "text": "138\nChapter 5There’s nothing wrong with sharing an article you wrote \nthree years ago—especially if it’s a great article.\nThe three ways you can then leverage your library of con -\ntent and “hack” the publishing landscape are:\n1. Delete your original post, change a variable \nor two, and publish it again.\nWhen you publish something to the internet, there are \na million variables that dictate whether or not that piece \nsuccessfully catches fire.\nMaybe you published it during an unlucky time of day. \nMaybe your original title didn’t have the right hook. Maybe \nyou realized after the fact that your post could have been \nflushed out further. Whatever the reason, there are no \nrules against deleting your original post and republishing \nit with a different set of variables. On Quora, this might \nmean publishing your answer to a different question. On \nMedium, this might mean changing the headline and \nadding it to a different publication. On Twitter, this might \nmean using different hashtags.\nThe only exception to this rule is if that piece was pub -\nlished on someone else’s website or a major publication. \nOnce something goes live in those environments, deleting \nit becomes a massive hassle and is extremely frowned \nupon. The reason is because as soon as a piece is live, it’s \nnow fair game to be shared and linked to—and what web -\nsites and publications want to avoid is a scenario where \naudience members have already shared or linked to your \ncontent, only for your article or story to be taken down and \nthe link to send people to a dead web page."

So the pro/con here \nis to weigh whether or not the original post accumulated \nenough attention to warrant “trying again.”\nMy personal advice is to avoid publishing and deleting \ncontent as often as possible. Instead, I’m a big believer in \njust re-writing a new and improved version and publishing \na second piece instead. This way, your library continues \nto expand (opposed to you constantly playing this game \nof create/delete/create/delete). If you are going to delete \na piece, do it within the first 24-48 hours to minimize the \nnumber of people who may be sharing it or linking to it.\n2. Build syndication relationships with websites \nand major publications, and get around the \n“duplicate content” rule.\n“Syndication” is when major publications build partnerships \nwith each other to share popular content.\nFor example, I wrote an article in 2016 for Inc Magazine  \ntitled, 7 Crucial Lessons People Often Learn Too Late In Life. \nThe article did well on Inc and accumulated around 70,000 \nviews. But it wasn’t until Business Insider  syndicated the \narticle that it really caught fire. The first time that article \ngot syndicated, it accumulated more than 3,000,000 views. \nSix months later, Business Insider  deleted it (see: above \ntactic) and republished it again, this time accumulating \nmore than 5,000,000 views. They chose to delete and \nrepublish it in order to make this clearly proven content \nseem as though it was a brand-new article on their site."

Which is why it’s to your \nadvantage to have your content appear in as many places \nas possible on the internet. You never know which environ -\nment is going to be the one that makes it “go.”\nHowever, the “con” of this strategy is what’s known as \n“duplicate content.” And since this is the most heavily \ndebated topic in all of content marketing and digital pub -\nlishing, it’s important to understand why I fundamentally \ndisagree with the duplicate content argument—and why \nI believe syndication is one of the greatest publishing hacks \non the internet.\n“Duplicate content” is the terminology Google uses to \nexplain their ranking system—and their dislike for seeing \nthe same exact content on multiple websites.\nThe only time you should be worrying about duplicate \ncontent (which means: the same exact content appear -\ning on multiple, different websites) is if you are writing \nwith a heavy focus on SEO—meaning you are running \na website and blog, which is your business , and you are \ncompeting for very specific search terms.\nIf this is the case, then going back to what I explained \nat the very beginning of this book, you are not “writing \nonline.” You are blogging.

This is \nhow SEO works.\nIf you do not fall into this category of bloggers, then you \naren’t going to be actively optimizing one single post for \nsearch. And if you aren’t actively optimizing one single \npost for search, then you gain almost nothing keeping it \nexclusively on your site—because you are never going to \nout-compete other blogs (businesses) for the keywords and \nkeyphrases in your article.\nIn short: writers who fear “duplicate content” think they’re \ndoing the right thing, not realizing they’re actually playing \na completely different game.\nKnowing I was never trying to write the #1 ranking blog \npost for any given keyword or keyphrase, I threw my \n“duplicate content” fears out the window and went all-in on \noptimizing for reach.

The reason opinions often go unheard is \nbecause the people writing them think that “just having an \nopinion” is the most important measure of success. It’s not. \nOpinions, just like Actionable Guides, have their own set of \nrules—and if you want to avoid being another navel-gazing \nblogger nobody cares to listen to, you need to find different \nways to communicate in order to stand out.\nThe techniques listed above for Actionable Guides work \nwell for Opinions, Curated Lists, Stories, and Credibility \npieces, so I won’t repeat them. Below are additional tech -\nniques that work well for Opinion writing.\n• “Better” Data:  If everyone else’s opinions \nare shot from the hip and aren’t backed by \nanything substantial, this is your opportunity \nto show up to the party with a satchel full of \nfacts. Conversely, if the most popular opinions \non a particular topic are overloaded with facts \nand statistics making them difficult to read, \nyou can be the one to write an entire piece \naround one single fact and make the topic \nmore digestible.\n• “Better” Quotes:  If everyone else is only \nwriting their own opinions, you can be the one \nto amplify your opinions by curating credible, \ninsightful quotes from other relevant voices."

(Writers like Ryan Holiday \ndo this often, where they will tell the reader \na story about someone famous or noteworthy \nfrom history, and then after telling the story \nthey will expand upon the story with their \nown personal opinions and insights.)  \n• “Better” Clarity:  If everyone else’s opinions \nare murky, disorganized, or unnecessarily \ncomplicated, you have an opportunity to \nmake things simple for readers.

Which \nmeans, if you’re writing about what’s happening within the \nworld of biotechnology, your Audience will only be as big \nas the number of people actively asking themselves about \nbiotechnology .\nHowever, a lot more people wake up in the morning and \nask themselves, “How can I be happier in life? How do \nI know if I’m in a healthy relationship? How can I make \nmore money?”\nThese broader, more universal questions have much \nlarger Audiences—which means, by choosing Happiness, \nRelationships, or Money as your Subject Matter, you will \ninherently reach a wider Audience.\nBefore you begin writing anything, you need to decide \nwho you are writing for.

I’ve coded the \nabove headline with different symbols (bold, underline, **, \nitalics, and {}), so we can get into the weeds here and talk \nabout each piece of the sentence.\nThe 1:\nThe first two or three words of a headline are arguably the \nmost important words of the sentence. When people are \nscrolling through titles, they really only look at the begin -\nning and the end. They want to know what this “thing” is \n(the beginning), and what will happen (the end/the PROM -\nISE) if they read it—all in a matter of milliseconds.\nThe beginning of this headline here immediately sets the \ntone: The 1.\nThat’s it.\nThere’s 1 and 1 only.\nThere are two reasons this technique of using a number at \nthe beginning of a headline is so effective. First, it conveys \nconviction, which readers trust. It’s declarative, and any -\nthing that is declarative implies a strong stance or opinion \n(which people love). Second, it sounds short. You’re not \nasking the reader to read about 10 different points, or 100 \ndifferent points. You’re saying, “You just need to know this \n1 thing,” which feels like a very low barrier to entry for a \nreader.\n“Meh, this will only take me a second to read,” they say to \nthemselves, right before they click."

My recommendation \nfor using these proven formats is to think of ways you can \nincorporate them into your individual style.\nHere are some of the most proven headline formats in \nonline writing:\n• Big Numbers:  For example, “3,000 People \nJust Filed For Unemployment In This Small \nTown In Arkansas. Here’s Why.” This is a \ngreat headline because “3,000 People” is \nconcrete, definitive, easy to imagine, and yet \nan unexpectedly large number—and what’s \nunexpected is exciting.\n• Dollar Signs:  Money is about as universal as \na topic can get. “$400 Million Is How Much \nYou Need To Make In Order To Afford This \nInsane Mansion In Malibu” is eye-catching \nbecause very few people have $400 million. \nDollar signs make the Curiosity Gap wider \nand more interesting for readers."

If you are \nhell-bent on writing at an academic level, \nrealize you are writing for a considerably \nsmaller audience—which means, by defini -\ntion, your material will almost never be read \nby the masses. If what you want is broad \nexposure, then it’s important for you to use \nnon-complicated language. For example, \ndon’t use semicolons (very few people under -\nstand how they work anyway). If there’s \na simpler synonym for a word less than 10% \nof society knows the definition to, use it. \n(Why? Because most people don’t use words \nlike, “prodigious” or “confounding” when \nthey speak. They just say, “Wow that was \namazing.”)"

Pay close attention to the \nrhythm of your natural sentences, versus \nthe rhythms you try to use when writing to \n“sound” more professional in your writing. As \na rule of thumb, anyone who tries to sound \nprofessional ends up sounding inauthentic, \nand those who lean into their authentic voice \nend up being perceived as the most relatable.\n• Avoid long sentences.  Unless you’re using \none long sentence stylistically, like to \ncounterbalance a paragraph of many short \nsentences, you should err on the side of brev -\nity. The more winding your thoughts, the \nmore confusing your writing will be for the \nreader to follow. Remember, you are writing \nfor someone whose eyes are flying across the \npage at lightspeed.\n• Alternate sentence length. If you read your \narticle and find most of your sentences and \nparagraphs are all the same length, you have \na rhythm problem. Short sentences should be \nfollowed by longer sentences. Longer sen -\ntences should be followed by short sentences. \nShort paragraphs should be followed by \nlong paragraphs, and really long paragraphs \nshould be followed by really short para -\ngraphs.

Here, the words in the sentence \nactually say “helping people,” so when paired with a link, \nit’s safe to say a reader will think to themselves, “Well, I’m \nlooking for help—I wonder where this goes.” Instead of \ncalling out your product or service directly, you’re letting \nthe reader discover it on their own.\nMy personal preference when it comes to CTAs is to always \nmake them feel like helpful and relevant resources for the \nreader, but to never give them the spotlight. Very little is \ngained by trying to hard-sell readers on anything. Instead, \nit’s far better to not try to sell them at all, and to just make \nwhatever it is you do want to promote easily accessible.\nIf the reader wants what you have to offer, trust they’ll \ntake it upon themselves to navigate there on their own.\nAnd if they don’t, let them continue reading in peace.\nOtherwise they won’t want to read any more of your mate -\nrial."

Sure, there are outliers who \nhappen to find success with just a small batch of material, \nbut 99% of the time, volume is what separates “good” from \n“great.” The more material you have, the more times you’re \n“spinning the wheel” of social algorithms, and the more \nlikely new readers are to discover you and your work.\nIn the game of Online Writing, volume wins.\nEvery time you write something online, your footprint gets \nbigger.\nThe more material you write within a given category, the \nmore dominant your voice becomes.\nAnd the longer you stick with it, new writers in your chosen \ncategory  will start to compare themselves to you.\nHow?"

When I wrote \nfor Inc Magazine,  some of my most-popular articles piggy -\nbacked on events happening in the news: Mark Zuckerberg \nmaking an announcement, the Golden State Warriors win -\nning a championship, etc. Since search volume and social \nmedia engagement around those topics was high, those \npieces received a disproportionate amount of attention in \nthe short term.\nUnfortunately, timely content is a double-edged sword.\nIf you think of your writing over the span of 10 years \n(opposed to 10 days), these timely pieces have a very \nshort shelf life. It wouldn’t make sense for me to re-pub -\nlish or re-share my article about an announcement Mark \nZuckerberg made seven years ago. I would need to do \na considerable amount of re-writing in order to make that \n“same article” relevant today—and in most cases, I’d be \nbetter off just writing something new.\nIn this sense, only writing timely material makes it difficult \nto build a library of content that lasts."

They could be read today, or \nthey could be re-read ten years from now, and they would \nstill remain valuable to the reader. The principles are \nuniversal.\nOf course, not everything you write will remain a “perfect” \nreflection of how you think or feel over the long term. For \nexample, some of the things I wrote in 2014, 2015, and \n2016, I no longer agree with—or would explain differently \ntoday. And that’s OK. Because for every piece where that’s \nthe case, there are ten more I re-read and think to myself, \n“Wow, I completely forgot I worded it this way—this is \ngreat.” What’s important is that I, as the writer, have the \noption of making that decision for myself (opposed to the \ndecision being made for me simply because a topic is no \nlonger relevant).\nTimeless content very rarely commands the same level of \nhype that a trendy, hyper-relevant, timely piece receives \nin the moment. It’s hard to compete against something the \nentire country, or even the entire world is fixated on for \n24-48 hours. However, where timeless content “wins” is \nin its ability to endure. A timely article might accumulate \n10,000 views in a day, and then fade into the abyss—\nwhereas a timeless article might accumulate 5,000 views \nevery year for ten years.\nAnd I much prefer the latter.\nThe reason timeless content is a better long-term investment "

The larger of a \nfootprint you can bring to new platforms, the faster you will \neffectively position yourself as “the king” of your chosen \ncategory —and over time, this flywheel will continue to spin \nfaster and faster.\nFor example, one of the reasons I was able to grow so \nquickly on Medium was because I already had 2,000+ \nusable articles in my library of content.\nI didn’t start writing on Medium until 2017.

Niche Audience: Your second content bucket \nshould be hyper-relevant to your expertise. If \nyou’re the VP of Marketing, then your niche \naudience would be “marketers”—and refined \nfurther, maybe “content marketers.” When \nspeaking to this audience, you have the \noption of continuing to leverage universal \ntopics to broaden your reach, or intentionally \nexcluding general audiences by speaking \ndirectly to the intimate pain points your \ntarget reader is experiencing.

Niche Audience:  Online writing advice, \nself-publishing, and content marketing.\n3. Company/Industry Audience:  Thought \nleadership and personal branding, specifi -\ncally for executives, founders, investors, etc.\nNow, it’s important to remember that your content buckets \ncan, and most likely will change over time. When I first \nstarted writing on Quora, I experimented with a ton of \ndifferent Niche Audiences before data told me what people \nreally wanted to hear about from me most.

For example, most YouTubers \nmake money by running relevant pre-roll ads on their \nvideos.

When someone reads one of my articles, Inc makes \nmoney, and in turn, I make money. (For context: I made \na penny per page view. So even with millions of views on \nmy work, I wasn’t exactly going yacht shopping.)\nWhile the advertising model might seem great, it has \na handful of flaws:\n1. People hate ads.  If you’ve ever tried read -\ning an article on Inc or Forbes  or any other \nmajor publication, you’ve experienced the \n10-second seizure your computer goes into \nbefore letting you scroll down the page. Then, \nas soon as you start to scroll, a Kia video ad \ntakes over your screen. This is bad for reader \nloyalty—and why social environments are \nmuch more beneficial for building audiences.\n2.

Universities need \ncontent.\nThe list goes on and on.\nThe internet is nothing more than one massive library of \ncontent. In order for us to communicate with each other, \nwe need things to read, watch, listen to, consume, and \nshare. That means essentially every single entity with a \npresence on the internet, in some sort of capacity, needs \ncontent—and if you can provide the words they need, then \nyou’re in demand.\nThat said, the biggest mistake “content writers” make, as \nwell as the companies who hire them, is thinking their job \nis to write words. And it’s not.\nMost content writing jobs hyper-focus on word count. “We \nneed several 500-word blog posts,” or, “We need a 3,000-\nword Whitepaper.” But all words are not created equally. \nHere, let me show you.\nExample 1:  Most content writing jobs \nhyper-focus on word count.\nExample 2:  Giraffes eat purple but sunshine is \nthe reason.\nBoth these sentences have eight words. Are they both valu -\nable to you, the reader?\nNo."

The goal is not to write a \n500-word blog post, or a 3,000-word Whitepaper.  \nThe goal is to write something that is even more valuable, \nand even more relevant  to the target reader—and success -\nfully encourages them to take some form of action (sign up \nfor a newsletter, purchase a product, etc.).\nIf you can deliver this sort of result, you will have no prob -\nlem earning a living as a writer.\nGhostwriting & Speechwriting\nThink of ghostwriting as luxury content writing.\nIf content writing is primarily for companies, then ghost -\nwriting is for the people who run and represent those \ncompanies (and/or any other public personality).\nI fell into the world of executive ghostwriting when I was \n26 years old. No one told me this industry existed. None \nof my teachers in college ever mentioned it as an option. \nWhat happened was, a very successful entrepreneur who \nhad previously sold his company for north of a billion \ndollars, sent me an email. He was an avid reader of my Inc \nMagazine  column, and was wondering if I would be willing \nto help him share his stories and insights as an entrepre -\nneur as well.\nOne client turned to two.\nTwo turned to four."

Some people refuse to let someone else \n“write” for them—which is fine, they aren’t your ideal \nclient. And many writers refuse to lend their pen to some -\none else. Personally, I don’t see ghostwriting this way. I see \nit much closer to co-writing, in the sense that I could be \nthe most talented writer on the planet, but I don’t have the \ninsights, the stories, or the palette of colors to write what -\never is being shared with me in conversation from someone \nmuch more experienced and further along in their career.\nIt might be my pen, but it’s unquestionably their thoughts, \nideas, and perspectives.\nThe reason ghostwriting is such a viable path for writers \nis because, for one, you essentially get paid to build an \nimmensely valuable network. Second, ghostwriting is far \nmore lucrative than conventional content marketing. You \nhave to remember, you aren’t selling “words on a page.” \nWhat you’re selling is clarity of a message—and so how \nmuch is it worth, to that particular person, for them to \ncommunicate clearly?\nThird, ghostwriting requires you to learn how to write in \na wide variety of voices. Writing for a male executive is \ndifferent than writing for a female executive. Writing from \nan investor’s point of view is different than writing for \na founder. Writing for a musician is different than writ -\ning for a professional athlete is different than writing for \na politician. "

Whether we realize it or not, we \nas writers are “selling” readers our ideas. This entire book \nis dedicated to “selling” you on the idea that you should \nwrite online.

For example, it’s common for world-class sales \ncopywriters to get paid six figures to write a single sales \nletter.
