Introduction \nPATHWAYS TO  \nGRADUATE\nSCHOOL\nStatement of Academic PurposeDrafting your statement Prompt\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nDrafting your statement\nengineering.princeton.eduMy work focuses in particular on analyzing fracture patterns from\nimages of frescoes and developing a model of brittle fracture. This\nproject has opened my eyes to a broad range of investigatory\noptions in computer graphics and motivated me to pursue\ngraduate studies to deepen my understanding and expertise in\nareas of visualization, computational photography, and simulation. What have you\nbeen interested\nin?\nWhat did you\ndo to explore\nyour interest or\ndeepen your\nknowledge?\nBody Paragraph 1\nI conducted research that analyzed fracture patterns observed in\nfrescoes excavated from site C.\nI developed a two-stage processing pipeline for this purpose. \nIn the first stage, I used an interactive program to trace detailed\nfragment boundaries in high-resolution images of manually\nreconstructed frescoes. The output was a polygonal mesh, with\neach polygon representing a fragment. Next, I implemented\ngeometric analysis algorithms to study the shapes and contacts of\nthe fragment boundaries. Specifically, I produced statistical\ndistributions of the lengths of cracks, the angles at which cracks met,\nthe fragment areas, and the adjacencies found in fragment\narrangements. \nThe main contribution of my study is a statistical model for crack\npatterns of fractured frescoes, which can guide scoring functions\nused in computer-assisted fragment reconstruction algorithms and\nalso suggest a generative model about fracture processes.Define\nproblem/task\nWhat did you\ndo/how did you\napproach the\nproblem?\nWhat did you\nproduce?\nNow sum up: your\ncontribution to\nthe larger project\nRepeat (if there\nare other\nprojects)Formula:Prompt\nPATHWAYS TO  \nGRADUATE\nSCHOOL\nStatement of Academic Purpose\nBody Paragraph 2\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nengineering.princeton.eduIn my graduate study, I wish to do research in the area of computer\ngraphics with broad applications in other disciplines. \nFor these reasons, the EECS department at Institution X is especially\nattractive to me.
